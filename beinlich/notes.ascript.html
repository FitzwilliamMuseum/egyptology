<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The application is a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) program written in
  Applescript which controls the interaction between the MacHTTP/Webstar server program and
  the Filemaker Pro database which does the real work. It works like this:</p>
<p>

</p>
<ol>
  <li>User types data in the form and clicks submit. The reference to the CGI
    program and the form data are sent to the server.
    
  </li>
  <li>MacHTTP recognises this as a CGI call and passes the data on to the CGI
    program as an Apple Event.
    
  </li>
  <li>The Applescript CGI program interprets the Apple Event and the data, arranges
    it in a certain way, and tells Filemaker Pro to search the database, and write
    the results to a file.
    
  </li>
  <li>The URL for this file is sent back to your WWW client software, which then
    retrieves and displays the file.
    
  </li>
</ol>


<p>The advantage of this system is that it lets Filemaker Pro do what it is best at
  (database work) while letting me set things up the way I want them to be.
  Although Applescript is not as fast as conventional programming languages, why
  write a database program when they exist already?</p>
<p>
  
  The CGI approach is operating system independent. Just because the server runs on
  a Mac doesn't mean that you have to use a Mac to access it. Any WWW client
  software from any machine can theoretically access a CGI application &quot;seamlessly&quot;
  as the marketing people say. I think this is the best way yet to put various
  Egyptological databases on line.</p>
<p>
  
  The down side of the Applescript/Filemaker approach is that it is slower than
  using a specially optimised program. It's like the speed of Assembly language as
  against Pascal or C. BUT in the longer term it may be more flexible as it can
  also be adapted to edit online data without writing a whole new program.
  
</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>The CGI program is only active for a few seconds per search. Searches with @ and
  * take a lot longer. The more data which is found by the query, the longer the
  response time. The big imponderable is the time take to interact with the
  server. The server on which the database runs can be very busy with
  many users accessing it simultaneously, and this can slow things <b>dramatically</b>. 10-15 seconds is the sort of average access time we get in
  Cambridge. For reasons explained above, this method will never be as fast
  as a specially optimised program.
  
</p>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>I have tried the CGI with what I hope are the most recent versions of the
  following WWW client software: Netscape (PC/Mac), Macweb, Lynx (Unix), Mosaic
  (PC/Mac/X), and it seems to have run OK. Older versions of Mosaic were not too
  happy. Let me know if your software fails to run. </p>
<h3>Problems</h3>

Filemaker Pro version 2.1v3 is not case sensitive. This is particularly
irritating with the <i>Manuel de codage</i> transcription system, since you may
well get back a lot of data you didn't expect. There is no obvious solution but
to wait for Claris to fix it.<p>

At present it isn't possible to get results if you type umlauts in the search
boxes. This is because, as far as I know, the WWW client software cannot encode
them and send them to the server, although it is capable of interpreting encoded
ones sent to it. Presumably future improvements will permit this.

</p><h3>Ideas for development</h3>

The text is returned in plain form at the moment, without formatting. I have
developed a version which will return the result as a HTML table, but not all WWW
client software yet supports tables, so either I will have to wait, or add an
option to return a tabular result.<p>

I would appreciate other ideas.
