The fortress is 500 metres long, 250 metres wide and with walls 13-metre thick and a 12-metre-wide south entrance. A giant water-filled moat that once surrounded the fort was also found.</p>

			<p>&quot;This is the largest fortress found yet,&quot; Abdel-Maqsoud told Al-Ahram Weekly, adding that it consisted of 24 huge defence towers 20 metres in width and four metres thick. Along with Tharo West, Abde- Maqsoud said, the fort was considered to be the eastern front of the ancient Egyptian military town of Tharo and Egypt's gate to the Delta. It was also the point where the ancient Egyptian army carried out several military campaign to secure the eastern the city borders at the time. Graves of soldiers and horses were also found. &quot;Bones of humans and horses found in the area attest dramatically to the reality of such battles,&quot; Abdel-Maqsoud said.'</p>

			<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mummies and Red Lead Paint</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>'Demetrios recently underwent X-ray fluorescence, a process whereby objects and materials are exposed to short wavelength X-rays that excite atoms and cause them to release radiation. This radiation has energy characteristics of the atoms within the object, so the technique helps researchers to determine what chemicals might be present.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Bruno said the lead painted on Demetrios matches the chemical profile of lead from Spain's Rio Tinto region, which has been a site for silver and other mining operations for over 5,000 years.'</p>

			<p>'X-ray fluorescence will allow analysis of the painted surfaces associated with the wrapping of mummies, including painted linen bandages and shrouds. Preliminary results have shown that the red paint used on the Demetrios mummy may have been made, in part, from components imported from Spain.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The lead in the paint is suspected to have come from a Spanish silver mine, but it remains unclear whether the paint itself was manufactured there or, alternatively, whether if the lead ingredient was traded to Egypt with the paint then produced locally.'</p>

			<p>'She explained that lead is a byproduct of smelting to extract silver. It is then likely that Spain either exported raw lead at the time of Demetrios' death from around 94-100 A.D., or the lead was made into Spanish paint before making its way to Egypt.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>'&quot;At the time, Egypt was in the Roman Empire, so the finding reveals how widespread trade was throughout the empire,&quot; Bruno said. &quot;The mix of cultures probably was not unlike what exists today in Egypt.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Imported materials would have been hard to come by and therefore probably expensive, so Bruno and her team now speculate that Demetrios was a very wealthy individual. &quot;Red shroud mummies,&quot; of which Demetrios is an example, are exceptionally rare, with only 10 known to exist in the entire world.'</p>

			<p></p>
			<p>'Zahi Hawass, Egypt's secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, who led the one- year study that led to the identification of Hatshepsut's mummy, used CT scans to link distinct physical traits of Hatshepsut to that of her ancestors, and narrow the search for the Pharaoh to the couple of female mummies in the KV60 tomb.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Hawass said the final clue lay within a box inscribed with the female Pharaoh's name.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A scan of the box revealed a tooth, which, when measured, matched within a fraction of a millimetre to the space of the missing molar in the mouth of the mummy called KV60A. This was the unidentified female originally found by Carter next to Hatshepsut's nanny.'</p>

			<p>'Hawass instructed curators at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo to look for the second mummy found by Carter and moved by Ayrton in 1908. They found it on the third floor of the museum. Examinations revealed that the badly damaged coffin is typical 18th Dynasty and among the inscriptions engraved on it is &quot; wr Sdt nfrw nswt In, [great royal nurse In].&quot; The mummy inside is 1.5m tall while the coffin is 2.13m, suggesting that the coffin was not originally intended for the mummy it contains. &quot;The obese mummy still in the tomb is significantly taller, and would fit much better in the coffin,&quot; says Hawass. The examination also revealed that the mummy in the Egyptian Museum has her right hand by her side and the left hand across her abdomen, with the hand closed as if it was originally holding something. She was mummified in fine linen, with the fingers wrapped individually. The toes were evidently wrapped together; this wrapping has been torn away, as if the robbers were looking for gold. The woman was eviscerated through a U-shaped incision in the abdomen. She has long curly hair remaining on her head. There is also a mass of linen at the bottom of the coffin but this is not of the same quality.'</p>

There's a length of intestine and a couple of other things--they almost look like small linen rolls, not very opaque like a bone would be--but they aren't discussed (which is frustrating). Finally, there's someting small and bright in the image--it's a tooth! Dental expertise is summoned up in the form of Galal El-Beheiri, a Cairo University professor of orthodontics. He identifies it as a molar with one root preserved and the other broken off. Comparisons are then made with teeth in KV60A and B. The latter is mising incisors, so that's not a match. KV60A is missing several teeth, including a molar of which only a single root remains. The tooth and root match in terms of size, suggesting that (if the chest contents are Hatsheput's) KV60A is the queen.'</p>

			<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling Ramesses' Hair</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>'French police have arrested a man who tried to sell on the Internet strands of hair from the head of the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II, a law court official has said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The man, who was not immediately identified, asked for between 2,000-2,500 euros ($2,639-$3,299) for each of the various hair samples as well as for tiny pieces of resin and embalmed cloth taken from the pharaoh's mummy.'</p>

			<p>He advertised &quot;strands of hair from the mummy of Ramses II&quot; for sale at 2,000 euros (&pound;1,350), saying he could prove their authenticity with photos, certificates, embalming resin and bandages.</p>

			<p>The head of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, Zahi Hawass, told AFP in Cairo that &quot;if these elements are authentic, it would be a scandal that would risk harming relations between France and Egypt&quot;.'</p>

			<p>'The seller, a 50-year-old Frenchman, claimed the lot belonged to his father who was part of a team of scientists who analysed the royal mummy when it was sent to France in 1976 for electromagnetic treatment against decay.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The mummifed body of Ramses II, who reigned from 1279 to 1213 BC, was the most important ever to leave Egyptian soil.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>At the time, samples of its hair, resin and bandaging were collected from fragments that fell from its shroud in transport and sent to various laboratories around France for analysis.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>French authorities recently wrapped up a judicial investigation into the case, but are not expected to press charges against the seller, according to deputy state prosecutor Luc Fontaine.'</p>

			<p>'No one knew about the objects until early last month when Jean-Michel Diebolt, a 50-year-old postman living in the Alpine region of France, advertised the samples online. This prompted a storm of outrage from Egypt, which is particularly sensitive about any pilfering of its heritage.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Diebolt, who was briefly arrested by the French police, said the samples came into his possession via his late father, one of the team of French scientists charged with analysing the royal mummy 30 years ago. During the analysis the French physician took 41 samples from the mummies of Meneptah and Ramses II.'</p>

			<p>'A forensic scientist has shown that the bones and linen fragments discovered in the attic of a Paris pharmacy in 1867 were not those of a woman who had died in the 15th century.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Instead, it appears that the bones belong to a person who had died some time between the 6th and 3rd centuries BC, and had been embalmed in the manner of ancient Egypt.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>After the &quot;relics&quot; came to light in the 19th century they were recognised as genuine by the Catholic Church and have since been held in a museum in the Loire town of Chinon.'</p>

			<p>The relics were found in 1867 in a jar in the attic of a Paris pharmacy, bearing the inscription, &quot;Remains found under the stake of Joan of Arc, Maid of Orleans.&quot;</p>

			<p>'The relics of St Joan of Arc are not the remains of the fifteenth-century French heroine after all, according to European experts who have analysed the sacred scraps. Instead, they say the relics are a forgery, made from the remains of an Egyptian mummy.</p>

			<p>Joan was burned at the stake in 1431 in Rouen, Normandy. The relics were discovered in 1867 in a jar in the attic of a Paris pharmacy, with the inscription 'Remains found under the stake of Joan of Arc, virgin of Orleans'. They were recognized by the Church, and are now housed in a museum in Chinon that belongs to the Archdiocese of Tours.</p>

			<p>Philippe Charlier, a forensic scientist at Raymond Poincar? Hospital in Garches, near Paris, obtained permission to study the relics from the French church last year. He says he was 'astonished' by the results. 'I'd never have thought that it could be from a mummy.'</p>

			<p></p>
			<p>'As explained by Dransoff, this item, which looks like an adult holding a small child, was listed in the Fabyans' probate papers as &quot;a mummified Native American. In 1980, there was some concern that a tribe would want to know it was here and want it returned. So the forest preserve hired an expert who took it to Dreyer Medical Clinic in Aurora to be X-rayed.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Turned out this is an ersatz mummy, crafted of common steel nails, a wood frame, straw and cloth. There is a real bone showing in part of the leg of the adult, but it is believed to be a dog bone.'</p>

			<p></p>
			<p>'The sarcophagus, made of fig wood, comes from a period when both the insides and outsides of these burial containers were elaborately painted or sculpted. Ancient Egyptians were known for their lavish tombs, with beautiful scenes on the walls. But grave robbing was already prevalent by 1000 BC, and so the scenes moved from the wall to the sarcophagus, which was often hidden in a cache in a temple.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The auction house has made no public estimate of how much they expect it to bring, although the last time a mummy was sold at auction was in May 2003, when Christie's in England set a record of $1.4 million. Max Bernheimer, the head of the antiquities department at Christie's, said that this sarcophagus is in better shape and that the house is confident it will go for more than $1.5 million.'</p>

			<p>'According to the head of Christie's antiquities department, G. Max Bernheimer, Holden was taking the &quot;obligatory trip up the Nile&quot; in the winter of 1900, when he learned that an Egyptian dealer had discovered a cache of four mummies and was offering them for sale. He bought this sarcophagus with its mummy, shipped it to Cairo for export clearance, and, on his return to Cleveland, donated it to the Historical Society, where the sarcophagus was publicly opened and the mummy partially unwrapped.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Historical Society is selling the mummy, Mr. Bernheimer said, because it doesn't fit their mission, which is to collect objects related to Northeast Ohio. The last mummy in its sarcophagus to go to auction was sold at Christie's in London in 2003 for $1.4 million. Christie's has entered this mummy in the catalog as &quot;estimate on request.&quot;'</p>

			<p></p>
			<p>'Description:</p>
			<p>AN AUTHENTIC EGYPTIAN MUMMY 'S HAND</p>
			<p>This is an actual hand from an Egyptian mummy, not a Hollywood prop. The intrigue behind this specimen is however no less than the movie, The Mummy's Hand, made by Universal in 1940. Though, a proper Egyptological explanation is not provided herein, the good state of its mummification indicates a possible date between the New Kingdom and the Ptolemaic period. The position of the fingers is a clue to the status and age of the specimen, while the relatively unusual gesture may have resulted from a ceremonial object being placed in the hand during mummification. Although the wrappings are gone, the specimen is beautifully preserved, exhibiting no deterioration and indicating that this hand may have belonged to high status individual. Although it is unquestionably authentic, its provenance can only be traced to an antique dealer from New Jersey. This specimen was acquired by a New York Collector in the 1960's and has remained in his collection for several decades. This rare piece from Egypt's ancient past measures approximately 6 1/2 inches in length.</p>

			<p>Description:</p>
			<p>AN AUTHENTIC EGYPTIAN MUMMY HEAD</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">The Western world has been fascinated with mummies since the 16th</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">Century. Around this time, it became common to grind up Egyptian mummies and use the resulting powder as a medicine to cure an assortment of ills. In the late 1700's, Napoleon's army conquered Egypt and the returning soldiers plundered countless treasures from the pyramids. During the Victorian era, mummies were eagerly collected by museums and private individuals absorbed by the mystery and prestige surrounding these objects of curiosity. A significant body of folklore surrounds corporeal preservation in ancient Egypt and the reality of mummification can be witnessed in museum exhibits. This lot is indeed such an artifact -- the actual head of an Egyptian mummy (guaranteed not to revive and stalk you with dragging leg and bandages).'</p>
