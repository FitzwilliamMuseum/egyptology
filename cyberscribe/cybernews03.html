Researchers hired by the National Geographic Society, one of the exhibit's sponsors, say current forensic data and recent CT scans of his mummy were used to create the images.<br>						<br>						&quot;We're concerned about fake pictures of one of our ancestors,&quot; said Ricky Innis, who leads Kheprera, a local black study group that focuses on ancient Egyptian history and culture. &quot;I'm sure people are disappointed the system would perpetrate this myth of information.&quot;<br>						<br>						Only the medium-skinned portrait was included in the Los Angeles exhibit. Activists from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Committee for the Elimination of Media Offensive to African People and the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations picketed outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art when the show opened there in June.<br>						<br>						Orlando Sentinel<br>						<a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-tut2505sep25,0,5185973.story?coll=orl-home-headlines">http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-tut2505sep25,0,5185973.story?coll=orl-home-headlines</a><br>						<br>						XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>						<br>						How Do You Take Your Tut, Black or with Cream and Sugar?<br>						<br>						King Tut's coming to Fort Lauderdale's Museum of Art in December, and he won't be alone. There is a coterie of &quot;African scholars&quot; and black activists who will be protesting the appearance of the boy king. You see the ex-Pharaoh's portrait doesn't look enough like Kanye West. King Tut appears in a medium skin tone as scientists chose the most common skin color in Eqypt today. According to the so-called scholars Tut was black. However, Terry Garcia of the National Geographic Society says, &quot; there is no way to judge a skin tone.&quot; So, scientifically you can't tell Tut's skin color from his corpse. Depictions of him within the tomb vary from light brown to dark brown to almost black. Can you really base the fact of his skin color on the varying skin tone interpretations of artists who&rsquo;ve been dead for millennia? The African scholars want to erase any doubt that Tut was anything other than a full-fledged black man, and they&rsquo;re not going to wait for science to bear that out. The question is, who are these people?<br>						<br>						In attendance at the Los Angeles museum were the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. As you can tell by it's name, this is an antiquated group. They've managed to drive the Civil Rights movement so far into the ground they should be picketing in China before long. At first, I thought it ill-advised that George W. Bush snubbed these folks in last year's convention prior to the election. But one can only smell the irrelevance and obsolescence of the NAACP. The president was stuck between snubbing them, pandering to them, or infuriating them by telling them the truth that they don't represent anybody anymore. He probably chose the wisest route by not showing up.<br>						<br>						Last, the black activists of today are indeed not funny. Their doctrine is a form of radical Afro-centrism and they&rsquo;ve had considerable success pushing their political agenda on academia (of course, the Left always says that that&rsquo;s what Republicans do). So, what is the goal of Afro-centrism? Scholars say it gives confidence to African-Americans who want to be proud of their history. How it is their history and why it&rsquo;s important to them is a mystery. I have never met a real African-American; someone born, say, in Nigeria and migrated to the United States. Granted, how certain cultural structures such as music and recipes for Gumbo survived the turmoil of slavery is interesting, but not of bedrock importance. The tradition of America with it&rsquo;s lofty creeds blows any other tradition away. That&rsquo;s why the rest of the world is envious, and looking back thousands of years, mutating history in the desperate effort to find a competitive alternative. To use a favorite epithet of the Left, they &ldquo;just don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;<br>						<br>						Opionion Editorials<br>						<a href="http://www.opinioneditorials.com/freedomwriters/jjordan_20050929.html">http://www.opinioneditorials.com/freedomwriters/jjordan_20050929.html</a><br>						<br>						XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>						<br>						2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Attempt to smuggle pharaoh's statue foiled<br>						<br>						Egyptian police have foiled an attempt to smuggle an ancient statue of Pharaoh Ramses II out of Egypt for sale to a foreign museum or private collector.

More to the point, in an annex to the tomb he found a wine cellar with 26 sealed amphoras of wine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these containers were not vitrified and liquids leach slowly through the sides of the jars. After 3,000-odd years, nothing was left in the jars but solid residue.

When the Earl died unexpectedly within weeks after the discovery, stories spread quickly that an ancient curse had been unleased as a consequence of disturbing the royal burial. The rumors grew extravagantly as time passed and more than twenty key persons connected to the discovery or its excavation died under untimely circumstances. The alleged curse, purportedly written near the entry to the tomb, that &ldquo;death will slay with his wings whoever disturbs the peace of the pharaoh&rdquo; was never documented, but it has persisted to this day. Ironically, belief in the existence and power of this mythical curse underscores a pervasive acknowledgement of Egypt&rsquo;s magical legacy.<br>						<br>						The key to activating this power lay foremost in the use of Iru (&ldquo;fabrications, ritual acts&rdquo;) and Medu Neter, &ldquo;divine words.&rdquo; Magical spells and visualizations were believed to have been given to the human race by the gods themselves, by the divine magician Djehuti who brought forth the word of creation, and the artisan of the universe Ptah, who generated the power to fashion and infuse objects with life. From their legends of magical happenings among gods and human beings that took place in timeless time, the ancient Egyptians understood that the world of possibilities, transcending life and death, was accessible to one in possession of the words and acts of creation.<br>						<br>						Llewellyn Journal<br>						<a href="http://www.llewellynjournal.com/article.php?id=925">http://www.llewellynjournal.com/article.php?id=925</a><br>						<br>						XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>						<br>						12)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit to Minya and Beni Hassan<br>						<br>						Riding on the train from the Giza train station to Minya, the scenery is green and full of life. Mud brick homes sit quietly next to sky piercing palm trees that seem to outline the lush horizon. Despite much publicised development schemes in rural Egypt, the three-and-a-half hour trip to Minya gives one the impression that things haven't changed that much at all. Women are still doing their laundry in irrigation canals, as water wheels turn to quench the soil's thirst. Although the train chairs were a little wobbly, a cool AC, complemented by a periodic rattle, helped me descend into an effortless infantile sleep.<br>						<br>						The following morning I headed to Beni Hassan, a half-hour ride on the Eastern bank of the Nile. The area is named after a Bedouin tribe which used to live there, probably a few centuries after it was part of the Middle Kingdom's Oryx nome. Climbing up the steps to the mountain tombs is quite a workout, especially if you go when the sun is on full blast. A hat and a few bottles of cool water are an utter necessity for this exhausting hike. When you reach the top of the cliff you realise that your efforts did not go in vain; the view is absolutely breathtaking. Presumably that is why the ancients chose this spot as their place of eternal rest. The sun's glimmer on the Nile's pristine blue surface, the green islands in the middle of the water, the seemingly ancient palm trees that sway with the breeze -- I was completely entranced. Just imagining this same view through the eyes of a provincial prince, as he carefully selects his tomb's location, was fascinating.<br>						<br>						Al-Ahram Weekly Online<br>						<a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/762/tr1.htm">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/762/tr1.htm</a><br>						<br>						XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>						<br>						13)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ancient Egypt in Wakefield Museum exhibition<br>						<br>						An extremely rare Anubis mask depicting the jackal-headed god of mummification is one of the stars of an incredible new Egyptian exhibition at Wakefield Museum.
