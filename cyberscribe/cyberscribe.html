					<h2><img height="43" width="35" src="scrbrn.gif" />The Cyberscribe</h2>
					<p>'Cyberscribe' is a <i>nom de plume</i> used by Dr Clair Ossian, past President of American Research Center in Egypt, North Texas chapter (ARCE NT) when he writes in the group's Newsletter. Clair, whom I have known for a few years, is highly knowledgeable about Ancient Egypt, and likes to spend some time, when he has it, trawling the net for interesting news about Egypt.</p>
					<p>When I realised that I was just not getting enough time to keep up the reputation of 'News and Gossip', Clair was the man I turned to for help, and he has kindly agreed to make available some material here.</p>
					<p>I am incredibly grateful to Clair for his co-operation. ARCE NT is an excellent chapter of the American Research Center in Egypt--the members are keen, knowledgeable, very interested and always a delight to speak to. I strongly urge anyone in the area interested in Egypt to join up, and also encourage colleagues to offer to speak in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where they will be guaranteed a warm welcome. Do check out <a href="http://www.arce-ntexas.org">their web site</a>.</p>
