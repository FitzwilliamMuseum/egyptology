In a press conference in Cairo, the minister said he wanted, by giving his resignation, to hold himself the only responsible party for the fire which erupted in the cultural center in Bani Sweif, adding that continuing his post does not exempt him from his responsibility about the incident. He stressed he will collaborate with the committee in charge of investigating this incident.<br>						<br>						Farouk Hosni submitted his resignation to President Mubarak after strong demands for his resignation by several Egyptian intellectuals who accused him of negligence that led to the fire.<br>						<br>						Arabic News<br>						<a href="http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050919/2005091904.html">http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050919/2005091904.html</a><br>						<br>						XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>						<br>						Culture Minister Farouk Hosni presented his resignation to President Hosni Mubarak late yesterday, reports Nevine El-Aref. Presidential and Culture Ministry sources told Al-Ahram Weekly that Mubarak offered no immediate reaction to Hosni's resignation offer.<br>						<br>						The culture minister's decision follows intense criticism in the wake of the disastrous fire that took place at the Beni Sweif Cultural Palace during a 5 September theatre performance. The fire, which left at least 46 people dead and 22 injured, was initially caused by lit candles that were part of the play's d&eacute;cor. When one of the candles was accidentally knocked down, the resulting blaze quickly spread to the curtains and other combustible elements that were part of the set, including paper and wood.<br>						<br>						The theatre itself was clearly ill equipped to handle emergencies; as hundreds of spectators, actors, theatre critics and intellectuals stampeded in fear, the main theatre door remained locked, thus trapping most of the panicked audience inside.

He allegedly also had handwritten Coptic Bibles in his luggage.<br>						<br>						Ross, an engineer who arrived in Cairo on Saturday, told airport officials he had met an Egyptian who asked him to carry the valuable papers to a London address, the security official said. Ross remained detained for questioning because Egyptian law classifies manuscripts that are more than 100 years old as antiquities.<br>						<br>						Nola.com<br>						<a href="http://www.nola.com/newsflash/international/index.ssf?/base/international-25/1124742939145020.xml&amp;storylist=international">http://www.nola.com/newsflash/international/index.ssf?/base/international-25/1124742939145020.xml&amp;storylist=international</a><br>						<br>						<br>						XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>						<br>						3)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stela depicting Cleopatra as male pharaoh discovered in China<br>						<br>						Researchers from Leuven and Beijing have retrieved great part of a unique Egyptian collection. In Beijing, an international joint research group from the Catholic University in Leuven and Beijing University discovered a collection of Egypt art that was believed lost for many years already. A Chinese ambassador to Cairo compiled&nbsp; the collection in 1906; when he died the items of the collection were distributed between the Beijing University Museum, the Arts Museum in Beijing and Beijing National Library.<br>						<br>						Chinese Ambassador Duan Fang wanted to exhibit the collecting in Europe, but failed to do it because of the revolution. The diplomat who took keen interest in Egypt cultures, one of the few intellectuals in China, was killed in 1911. After his death, the collection was scattered about various museums and some items were even lost. A year ago, Professor Willy Clarysse from the University of Leuven agreed to study a stela kept at the Beijing University Museum and allegedly belonged to Duan Fang collection. The study gave rise to forming the inventory of the whole of the unique collection. Discovery of the lost items are to be continued next year.<br>						<br>						Pravda<br>						<a href="http://english.pravda.ru/main/18/90/363/16113_cleopatra.html">http://english.pravda.ru/main/18/90/363/16113_cleopatra.html</a><br>						<br>						XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>						<br>						Cleopatra Found Depicted in Drag.&nbsp; A relief image carved approximately 2,050 years ago on an ancient Egyptian stone slab shows Cleopatra dressed as a man, according to a recent analysis of the artifact.
