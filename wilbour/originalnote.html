		<h1>Original note from 1995 by Diane Bergman </h1>
	<p>The Wilbour Library of Egyptology in The Brooklyn Museum has a long tradition of making its acquisitions information available. The first Acquisitions Lists were published between 1963 and 1965 in the ARCE Newsletter. Publication and distribution was done by The Brooklyn Museum itself between 1966 and 1972. We co-operated with Barry Kemp in <i>EGYPTOLOGY TITLES</i> between 1973 and 1979. During most of the 1980's we published with the library of the Universitaet Heidelberg. In the late 1980's we entered the computer age and began to control our acquisitions operation on a PC using the database program RBase. Since then, we have been printing the list ourselves and distributing them for a nominal charge.</p>
		<p>We are now happy to post our Acquisitions Lists on the Cambridge WWW site.</p>
		<p>The List consists of monographs, offprints and some analytics of journal articles. Our criterion for listing analytics is if the journal is not regularly analyzed by the AEB, then we shall list the article.</p>
		<p>I hope that the inclusion of the Wilbour Library Acquisitions Lists on the Internet will prove useful to all interested in the serious study of ancient Egypt.</p>
