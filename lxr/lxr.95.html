		<h1>Luxor, December 1995</h1>
		<p>Compared with 1994-5, the winter in Luxor in 1995-6 was very uneventful. No rainstorms, no operas...
		</p><h3>The consequences of the floods in 1994</h3>
		<p>Quite a lot of work has been done repairing the damage done by the floods of November 1994. The village of tents near the Sety temple has gone, and a new village has been built in the desert to the north of the Carter House. I didn't visit it, but it looks to be composed of very colourful small houses. A number of people have moved out there whose houses survived the floods but in a damaged condition. I am told that government funds were used to help build this. There are no signs of the villagers who live around the tombs moving however, although there is talk (as always) of another attempt at moving them.
		</p><p>One of the plans to deal with future floods is to build channels in some of the major sites to take away the water. The Valley of the Queens is the first to be so treated, and now has a rather different appearance from last year. Some tombs in the Valley of Kings are closed, either for resting or for restoration (Horemheb, Amenhotep II, and Ramesses VI).</p>
		<p>The German Archaeological Institute's work at the Sety temple has resumed, and they estimate that about four season's work was lost in the floods. The walls have been repaired and a lot of mud and debris removed.</p>
		<h3>New monuments</h3>
		<p>I noted two new tombs open. The first is of course that of Nefertari, and the stories of ways of getting tickets (limited to 150 foreigners paying LE 100 each) are many. The Antiquities Service is trying to stop taxi drivers buying them on behalf of tourists, insisting that they are bought personally by the tourists at the ticket office at the Inspectorate.</p>
		<p>I visited the tomb, something I have wanted to do for 20 years. I've been to talks, looked at books, but these still don't prepare you for it. It is impressive, and the colours are remarkable; it's also much bigger than I thought. The atmosphere is somewhat stifling, and there are signs of salt crystals growing again at the back of the tomb. So there is of course a chance it will get closed again.</p>
		<p>The other tomb to be opened is that of Pashed at Deir el Medina. This is another beautiful little tomb, which contains a well-known scene of the tomb owner praying under a palm tree. It is situated away from the other open tombs at the village site, and is on a separate ticket. Well worth a visit.</p>
		<p>It's not a new monument, but there is a large restoration/conservation programme being undertaken at Medinet Habu. A lot of work has been done on the later buildings at the front of the enclosure. Conservation was also been done on the tomb of Rekhmire. While we were there, President Hosni Mubarak announced a large grant to the Supreme Council for Antiquities to carry out further restoration work in Egypt. Unfortunately for the inspectors and other employees, there was no more money for salaries; wages have been cut in the past year from low to very low levels, and they may be cut further. I cannot feel this bodes well for the monuments, as many inspectors are leaving to earn their livings elsewhere.</p>
		<h3>Work going on in December</h3>
		<p>Most of the missions who have been working there for the past few years were present: Waseda University continue at the tomb of Amenhotep III, the Polish at Deir el Bahari, the German Archaeological Institute at the Sety temple and in the Private Tombs, Edwin Brock in the tomb of Merenptah, Chicago House at Medinet Habu, and ourselves in TT99 (<a href="http://www.newton.ac.uk/egypt/tt99.report.95/tt99.report.1995.html">see report here</a>). New missions were a Hungarian one working in the Thoth temple at the top of the hill to the north of the Valley of the Kings, and a Canadian one (R. Shaw and L. Brock) working on private tombs 120 and 89. There is depressing news from the Desert Survey being carried out by John and Deborah Darnell of Chicago House: many of the graffiti and other monuments they have visited in the far desert are being systematically stolen, and their only hope is to keep one step ahead of the thieves.</p>
		<h3>Other</h3>
		<p>The bridge a few km to the south of Luxor has been built now, but the approach roads are not finished. There are still arguments going on as to whether it should have been built, and many are worried about the effect on the West Bank. So we will have to wait and see what happens.
