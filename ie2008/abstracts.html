There are many answers to that simple question; it is our purpose today with only few but talented and committed benevolents. Moreover, we will propose some routes which may broader it toward a common standard such as Manuel du Codage (MdC) 2008, Hieroglyphs in Unicode, consistent lexicographic word lists, &#x2026;.</p>					<p><b><u>What is the Rosette Project today?</u></b></p>					<p>A three-year old online application, with still a long road ahead:</p>					<ul type="disc">						<li>a computer assistance to identify and read ancient Egyptian texts among a catalogue of 3000+ hieroglyphs, with associated description and palaeographic samples;						<li>including a dictionary (all Faulkner keywords with Griffith Institute authorization, and its counterpart in French by Medjat Association), and MdC compliant graphic editor, and a corpus of translated texts;						<li>with systematic association between hieroglyphic display, MdC coding, transliteration, multi-language translations, and reference to source documents;						<li>two home-made hieroglyphs fonts in Unicode format developed by the project team;						<li>totally free of charge and available on standard Internet, under Global Public Licence.					</ul>					<p>&nbsp;<b><u>Why and how Rosette could contribute to Egyptology?</u></b></p>					<p>The essential concept developed by Rosette is &ldquo;integration&rdquo;. From original text capture, to encoding, to displaying hieroglyphs, to searching a dictionary, to capitalize a corpus of ancient texts, to make all these freely available on the Web, in a user-friendly environment.</p>					<ul type="disc">						<li>The final product of Rosette aims at a computer tool to facilitate the access to hieroglyphic texts and Ancient Egypt culture.						<li>It offers several features rarely combined in one single software: hieroglyph editor, lexical and syntactic analysis, text corpus storage.						<li>It seeks at the most community-accepted standards, from an full MdC compliance, to the respect of Gardiner coding, to scalable-hieroglyphic font, to Unicode structure, to XHTML 1.0 validation of every web-page.						<li>Interactive concept: based on the Wiki approach, with additional security control, it will allow everyone to contribute to a community knowledge repository.						<li>Multi-language: so far available in French, English, and partly Arabic, the entire application is built to support as many languages as needed, should native translators be candidate.						<li>A benevolent contribution: surprisingly, dozens of Internet surfers jointed the project and brought their own skills. To succeed, this project requires many different kinds of competencies: IT experts, mathematicians, graphists, to support epigraphists, grammarians, historians, and many amateurs contributing with their knowledge and time availability.						<li>Other ideas under evaluation: statistical analysis of hieroglyph apparition by period; associating the genuine image to every document referenced in the database; cross-text search tools; OCR; portable version (including on PDAs);&#x2026;					</ul>					<p>Should a worldwide standard emerge in the coming years, it could allow all texts to be encoded in a unique format, available in one single database, with a common dictionary encompassing every expert's knowledge, assisted by a syntactic engine, and in multi-language translations. Even if these standards are not ready yet, nothing prevents to start capturing the data in a temporary format. Whatever Rosette can collect from now on, it will be easy to convert and transfer it to any future &ldquo;official database&rdquo;, blessed by the Egyptology Community, as soon as this database is created. Is not it worth starting the data collection now, in parallel with the development of the new standards?</p>					<p align="center">***</p>					<p><b><i>Michael EVERSON</i></b></p>					<p><font><i><b>Yod, Unicode, and future options for Egyptian encoding</b></i></font></p>					<p><font>The author will lead a discussion about the encoding of the Latin transliteration character Egyptological Yod.

The point is not to follow technological crazes. Rather there is a demand to define a way to use Information Technology for easy sharing and for long-term archiving of hieroglyphic texts. Egyptologists are a relatively small group of experts - and even smaller is the group of experienced IT persons within the subject of Egyptology. I am convinced that this situation will be a excellent opportunity to involve the group &quot;Informatique et Egyptologie&quot;.</p>					<p>In this paper I will present ideas and concepts that are important for a document type definition for hieroglyphic text in format XML. As well I will present a number of aspects concerning the cooperation with other important technologies.</p>					<p align="center">***</p>					<div align="left">						<p><b><i>Svenja A.

This project was made possible by the Alexander von Humboldt &#150; Stiftung who awarded for the second time the so-called Sofja Kovalevskaja Preis in November 2004, which was obtained by Prof. Dr. Mark Depauw (KU Leuven). He established this project at the Seminar f&uuml;r &Auml;gyptologie (University of Cologne), encouraged by Prof. Dr. Heinz Josef Thissen, the former Director of the Cologne Egyptological Institute.</p>						<p>In 2006 during the I&amp;E meeting at Oxford, the database-system of &quot;Trismegistos&quot; 							was presented. This lecture will discuss changes and advantages concerning the  							databases and presents new features of the online-version of &quot;Trismegistos&quot;.  							Building up this (online) database-system was the first aim of the project, the  							second aim is an in-depth analysis of factors influencing language preferences and  							shifts on the basis of &quot;Trismegistos&quot; and investigation of questions of inter- or trans-  								culturality in the context of the progressive hellenisation of Egypt.</p>						<p align="center">***</p>					</div>					<p><b><i>Willem HOVESTREYDT</i></b></p>					<p><b><i>The Annual Egyptological Bibliography: Recent and Latest Developments</i></b></p>					<p>In the summer of 2007 the Annual Egyptological Bibliography went online with a new website, where the entire bibliography can be consulted online.  Some important components of the website are still being worked on but will be implemented by the end of this year.  From then on the AEB can be updated on a daily basis.  This is an essential difference with the printed version which was always constrained by its &ldquo;annual&rdquo; format.  A number of isssues connected with this change will be addressed.</p>					<p>A second topic for discussion will be the AEB&rsquo;s financial and institutional future.  Some recent developments constitute ground for concern.

Since no commonly available ready-to-use Egyptological database software exists at the moment a custom-built database environment has been created for the purposes of the PhD-project in question which is based on the common Microsoft Access platform. Though being the work of non-IT professional and tailored to the specific requirements of the study the multi-purpose layout of the programme that covers among other things information on field archaeological contexts, dating, texts, palaeography, stylistic features, typology, personal names, titles, etc. could perhaps be applied successfully also by other Egyptologists conducting prosopographical or artefact-centered research.</p>					</div>					<p align="center">***</p>					<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Edward LORING</i></b></p>					<p><b><i>Sharing Images in the Internet</i></b></p>					<p>Since the advent of digital photography, many research institutions have collected more images than they will ever be able process and the collections continue to grow at a rapid pace. These images are all original material, showing the actual state of objects of all types and periods. Every institution hat its own focus(es) in Egyptology and can provide valuable information on these areas of study to the Egyptological community as a whole. By sharing these images with others, everyone would be able to make progress more efficiently. The Centre for Egyptological Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, CESRAS, has posted thousands of images on the web and placed them in the public domain for non-commercial purposes. This is essentially research raw material. Most of the photos were made enter very adverse conditions and, although they have immense educational value, are not of a quality for commercial publication in any case. Of course, there is also the question of copyrighted material belonging to museums and other institutions. It would be useful if researchers were allowed to make use of segments of such images as are published on the web on their own sites without administrative red-tape. For example, if someone wishes to use a detail from a papyrus published on the web by a museum this should be allowed an the provision that a link be made to the original image on the museum's site. This would be a win-win situation. The scholar would have what is needed and the museum would get more web traffic, generating more interest in its collections and perhaps selling the original image.</p>					<p>&nbsp;Over the years, there has been considerable discussion of de-central data bases. Such a construct could be realized through links to a central thesaurus. We propose the creation of such a network for images. We also encourage our colleagues in other institutions to place images for research purposes on the web and in the public domain. We invite discussion.</p>					<p align="center">***</p>					<p><b><i>Marcus M&Uuml;LLER</i></b></p>					<div align="left">						<b><i>Encoding Vignettes of the Book of the Dead</i></b>						<p>The Book of the Dead is one of the most important and most frequent attested religious texts of Ancient Egypt. Although approx. 50 % of all handwritings also show vignettes, which illustrate the spells, the research concentrates nearly exclusively on the texts. Even new editions often confine themselves to a description of the vignettes or offer just an image. A comparative analysis of the iconography or the style is missing. Often parallels are taken into account only in the philological comment.</p>					</div>					<p>Especially little attention is given to the vignettes of the Book of the Dead of the Saitic Recension. In comparison with its precursors of the New Kingdom they are regarded as standardized. Therefore the researchers trust in pTurin 1791 as a reference. This papyrus was published by Richard Lepsius in 1842 and is regarded as a parallel for the texts as well since that time. But the status of pTurin 1791 is unclear. Only a small amount of the 1400 known handwritings with vignettes is published. Therefore the multiplicity of the variants is largely unknown.</p>					<p>An overview of the material shows that one cannot orientate oneself to pTurin 1791 without problems. The variants are much more numerous than previously assumed. It can be assumed that local styles are associated with this variants.</p>					<p>The lecture will deal with the following questions: How can the material be processed to make the multiplicity of the variants clear? How can the material be processed to be able to investigate the local variants? How can the material be processed to classify clear types?</p>					<p align="center">***</p>					<p><b><i>PhD Hana NAVR&Aacute;TILOV&Aacute; / Dr. Renate LANDGRAFOVA</i></b></p>					<p><b><i>The Database of First Intermediate Period biographical texts</i></b></p>					<p>(joint paper with Dr. Renate Landgrafova, adapted from the paper present at X.

The phraseology of these texts will thus be traceable in time and place and possible to correlate with the owner's titles and functions.</p>					<p align="center">***</p>					<p>&nbsp;<b>Mark-Jan NEDERHOF</b></p>					<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Automatic alignment of hieroglyphic and transliteration</i></b></p>					<p>For the purpose of studying an Ancient Egyptian text, it is convenient to have the hieroglyphic printed on the screen or on paper aligned with the transliteration, and possibly translation or related resources. Manual alignment however requires much effort. Simple techniques are discussed to do this automatically for hieroglyphic and transliteration. Experiments with The Shipwrecked Sailor show that very high accuracy can be achieved.</p>					<p align="center">***</p>					<p><b>Vincent RAZANAJAO</b></p>					<p><b><i>The Electronic Text Corpora of Ancient Egyptian: XML Treatment of Processions of Nile-Gods</i></b></p>					<p>The procession of Nile Gods texts inscribed on wall bases in Late Period temples form an interesting corpus for an implementation of XML on Egyptian texts. Their own structure, which is organized on the two syntagms contribution / comparison (&ldquo;apport / glose d&rsquo;assimilation&rdquo; in French), and their own nature, let think that the use of XML on those texts will facilitate an exploitation of their semantic content.</p>					<p>Les textes des processions de soubassements des temples tardifs constituent un corpus int&eacute;ressant pour l&rsquo;application du XML aux textes &eacute;gyptiens. Leur structure m&ecirc;me, qui s&rsquo;articule autour des deux syntagmes apport/glose d&rsquo;assimilation, ainsi que leur nature, permet d&rsquo;esp&eacute;rer qu&rsquo;un traitement par XML de ces textes autorise une exploitation maximale des donn&eacute;es s&eacute;mantiques que ceux-ci contiennent.</p>					<p align="center">***</p>					<p><b>Serge ROSMORDUC &#150; Jean WINAND</b>					<p><b><i>Ramses.

Conversely, a model of, for example, ancient Egypt can be used to illustrate concepts from complex systems theory and test the universality of these concepts. In <i>Fractal house of pharaoh</i> [2], Mark Lehner takes a complex systems view of ancient Egyptian civilisation. We build on some of the aspects of this view in an agent based&nbsp; computer model.</p>					<p>The model is designed to investigate two areas: the spread of information and population aggregation in an agrarian society. The model is based on an abstracted Egyptian landscape containing villages, flood plain, and river. The agents represent farming families which exchange information and migrate around the landscape motivated by the availability of surplus food (used as a proxy for quality of life). We shall use this to illustrate many of the key ideas of agent-based modelling and complex systems. Further work will attempt to explore the impact of special features of Egyptian geography and society on the development of the civilisation.</p>					<p><b>References</b></p>					<p>[1] Dean, J.

La gen&egrave;se d&rsquo;une pens&eacute;e originale construite sur des fondements th&eacute;ologiques h&eacute;liopolitains donn&egrave;rent une teinte solaire au r&egrave;gne dont qui irradie encore les scientifiques et les amateurs. Une grande originalit&eacute; de cette p&eacute;riode historique r&eacute;side surtout dans l&rsquo;ampleur des projets architecturaux mis en place pour soutenir, voir propulser cette r&eacute;forme politico-religieuse. Elle se caract&eacute;rise &eacute;galement par des inventions technologiques comme sont les murs en brique de pierre (les talatat) ; des innovations fonctionnelles comme la suppression des toitures dans les sanctuaires des temples, le tout ouvrant sur un urbanisme original dont les extensions &agrave; l&rsquo;est du temple de Karnak et surtout la ville nouvelle d&rsquo;Amarna sont les plus beaux t&eacute;moignages. A partir de la documentation d&eacute;j&agrave; accessible nous proposons d&rsquo;appliquer une approche m&eacute;thodologique 3d (qui a d&eacute;j&agrave; fait ces preuve) afin de poser les bases scientifiques et m&eacute;thodologiques d&rsquo;une restitution des programmes architecturaux du r&egrave;gne.

Six chercheurs se sont engag&eacute;s &agrave; participer &agrave; ce travail collectif. Le travail s&rsquo;appuiera sur la Plate Forme Technologique 3D d&rsquo;Ausonius et cette expertise scientifique internationale. La mise en forme de la documentation ainsi que la mise en place initiale d&rsquo;un mod&egrave;le num&eacute;rique 3D de niveau V1 des principaux b&acirc;timents du r&egrave;gne sera la premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape &agrave; atteindre. D&rsquo;autres chercheurs seront sollicit&eacute;s ponctuellement pour participer &agrave; telle ou telle s&eacute;minaire en fonction des nouvelles probl&eacute;matiques qui appara&icirc;tront immanquablement lors du projet. Ces s&eacute;ances auront pour objectifs de porter les mod&egrave;les 3D vers une version V3 optimum en terme de validation des restitutions. L&rsquo;objectif affich&eacute; du projet consiste &agrave; une double valorisation des r&eacute;sultats scientifiques. D&rsquo;une part le r&eacute;sultat des s&eacute;minaires fera l&rsquo;objet d&rsquo;une publication qui servira de base &agrave; un colloque international sur l&rsquo;&eacute;tude du projet d&rsquo;urbanisme du r&egrave;gne d&rsquo;Akhenaton.
