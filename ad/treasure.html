Again a top 		quality CD ROM with 1500 pieces from the collection of the National Museum 		of Ireland. <p>		This CD-ROM offers an Egyptian collection for the greater part previously 		unpublished and unknown even within Egyptology. The collection covers the 		material culture of every age from Hierakonpolis, Abydos and Tarkhan in the 		Predynastic and Early Dynastic Period (5000-3000 BC) to the Roman Period 		cities of Oxyrhynchus and the Faiyum.
