<h1>New Teaching Grammar:</h1>

<i>Middle Egyptian Grammar</i> by James E. Hoch, University of Toronto (unpublished
manuscript) current length ca. 230 pp.; proposed final length: 450 pp.
including appendices, index of grammatical matters, glossary of Egyptian
vocabulary, glossary of technical terms, and sign list.

<P>The book will consist of 16 lessons (of which 13 now exist). Each lesson
contains a thorough exercise with translation and parsing sections. Later
translations contain fairly extended passages. Reading passages begin in
lesson 7 (a poem of a man contemplating death and suicide). The nearly
complete text of the Shipwrecked Sailor appears in serial form (with suitable
cliff-hangers) in the remainder of the reading passages. The exercises are
difficult, but interesting from the point of view of Egyptian culture,
education, religion, history, medicine, and literature.  

<P>The theoretical approach is "Standard Theory" with some innovations (Polotsky
Plus). The examples  are mostly in complete sentences and occasionally consist
of short passages to provide grammatical and semantic context (and review).

<P>The first 13 lessons can be taught in one Canadian academic year and cover
almost everything required for basic reading except some uses of the "negative
verb", _iwty_ "which not...", sDm.w.f "future active", and a few odds and ends
like the past-tense auxiliary verb p3(i).

<P>The manuscript (bound with plastic spine) is being distributed by the author
in order to elicit criticism and comments from instructors, students
(including self-learners), and scholars.

<P>A more or less complete and updated version (minus indexes, etc.) should be
available before the fall. Small orders for trial classroom use will be
possible, but instructors should make arrangements before July 30th, if
possible. (Different arrangements will be required for increased postage
costs.)

<P>In order to cover various expenses, the following charges are being asked:

<P>US orders: $24 (US) by airmail
Canadian orders: $25 (Canadian) by regular mail (ca. 7 days)
                             $30 (Canadian) by airmail (ca. 2 days)
All other orders: $28.50 (US) by airmail

<P>Cheques or money orders are to be made payable to James Hoch and sent to the
following address: ***Be sure to include your mailing address in your order

<P>Some comments about _Middle Egyptian Grammar_:

<P>* I really enjoy reading it! The format is helpful (small well structured
sections with lots of cross-referencing), and the exercises are pitched at the
right level.

<P>* The style is very pleasant, readable and contemporary... I hate/love the
parsing exercises. More often than not you hit on one I've glossed over in the
text.

<P>* It looks nice!

<P>* It's a beauty.
