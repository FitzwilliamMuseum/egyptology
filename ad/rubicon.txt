Book DescriptionThe Black Pharaohs - Egypt's Nubian RulersHow did modern Sudan's ancient civilisation conquer, rule then loseits dominion over Pharaonic Egypt?The Rubicon Press is pleased to announce the publication of a new book,   The Black Pharaohs - Egypt's Nubian Rulers - a major historical and   archaeological study on the rise and fall of ancient Egypt's one-time   black rulers.The Black Pharaohs is a detailed and provocative reassessment of the   Kushite kingdom, which, at its height, stretched from the Mediterranean   far into modern Sudan, while influencing large parts of Black Africa and   much of western Asia including Syria and The Lebanon.Written by Dr Robert Morkot, a renowned scholar and Egyptologist   specialising in the ancient Kushite civilisation, The Black Pharaohs   describes the extraordinary scope and influence of the Kushites at a time   of remarkable social, cultural and military upheaval in north and north   east Africa and the Near East.For nearly one hundred years, between 750 and 650 BC, the Kushite kingdom   was one of the greatest powers on earth.  The Kushites were seen by the   princes of western Asia, notably the kings of Israel and Judah, as their   defenders against the might of the Assyrian empire.  Inevitably, their   championing of the Asiatic kingdoms brought the Kushites into conflict   with the Assyrian empire.  It was the strength of Assyria combined with   the self-interest of the Libyan dynasts of the Egyptian Delta that   eventually forced the Kushites out of Egypt, putting a stop to Nubia's   Pharaonic ambitions.In this major work of more than 350 pages and 116 illustrations, Robert   Morkot examines Nubia's legacy in ancient Egypt, describing the impact of   this often under-estimated people.  Where did the powerful Kushite   kingdom come from?  How was it able to conquer Egypt and gain such   influence in western Asia?  What influence did the Kushites wield in   Egypt and amongst Egypt's neighbours in Africa?Until recently, the Kushite kingdom was thought to have burst from an   historical void.  But, over the past decade, there has been a   considerable reassessment of the origins of this powerful state.  Indeed,   the archaeology of this period of Nubian history has become the focus of   heated academic debate.  Much of this debate and subsequent controversy   has focussed on the minutiae of archaeology.As a leading scholar in this field, Dr Morkot seeks to give a more   expansive view of the era, incorporating a great deal of new evidence and   interpretation.  The Black Pharaohs takes a much broader approach,   placing the Kushite kingdom in its greater historical context, and in a   long tradition of formidable opposition to Egyptian southward expansion.      As well as significant Egyptian and Nubian evidence, the mass of Assyrian   texts, some of which have been published only recently, sheds further   light on the cultures and conflicts of these ancient super-powers.    Altogether, this book draws on fresh evidence and analysis, and presents   a new, and perhaps controversial, reassessment of the Kushite kingdom.Publication DetailsFull title:   The Black Pharaohs - Egypt's Nubian RulersHardback ISBN:   0-948695-23-4Price Hardback:   UK£ 29.95   US$ 59.95Paperback ISBN:  0-948695-24-2Price Paperback:  UK£ 19.95   US$ 29.95 Pages:   352Illustrations:   116 b&w and line drawingsFormat:   234 x 156 mmDate of Publication:            February 2000  (Rights available.)ReadershipThe Black Pharaohs is written as a scholarly narrative intended to appeal   to a broad range of readers including Egyptologists, Assyriologists,   archaeologists, historians and travellers, with particular interest in   the origins and development of ancient Egyptian, Black African and   Asiatic history and culture.The AuthorRobert Morkot graduated from University College London (UCL) in 1980 with   a degree in Ancient History.
