The current version contains anindex, a key to about 1/2 of the exercises, and an Egyptian-English vocabularylist. The book is Volume 15 of SSEA Publications and the co-publisher isBenben Publications. Although it is now a recognized book, the "real,"official publication will be around late 1997 or 1998. Production anddistribution are currently still done by the author. Users' suggestions,comments, and criticisms are always most welcome!<BR><P>The book contains 16 lessons. Each lesson has a thorough exercise withtranslation and parsing sections. Later translations consist of fairlyextended passages. Reading passages from <EM>interesting</EM> original textsbegin in lesson 7 (a poem of a man contemplating death and suicide from the"Dispute between a man and his ba"). The complete text of the "ShipwreckedSailor" appears in serial form (with suitable cliff-hangers) in the remainderof the reading passages. The exercises are difficult, but interesting from thepoint of view of Egyptian culture, education, religion, history, medicine, andliterature.<BR><P>The theoretical approach is "Standard Theory" with some innovations. Theexamples are mostly in complete sentences and occasionally consist of shortpassages to provide grammatical and semantic context (and review).<BR><P>The publisher has set the following prices:<BR><BR>US & overseas orders: $50 (US)<BR>Canadian orders: $60 (Canadian)<BR><P>Note the following discounts for multiple-copy orders: 2-3 copies 20%discount; 4 or more copies 40% discount.<BR><P>***Be sure to include your mailing address in your order ***<BR>Cheques or money orders are to be made payable to James Hoch and sent to thefollowing address: <BR><P>Dr. James Hoch<BR>223 Glebeholme Blvd.<BR>Toronto, Ontario Canada M4J 1S8</BODY></HTML>
