MEMO FROM JOHN WILLIAM PYE RARE BOOKSJanuary 24, 1996Dear Customers:This message is meant to announce the reprinting of two more importantEgyptolog-ical titles. Each will be offered at the prepublicationprice which is in effect until April 30, 1996. The books are presentlyin production and should be ready at the end of March.The first title, continuing in the series begun with MYCERINUS, isGeorge A.  Reisner's THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EGYPTIAN TOMB DOWN TO THEACCESSION OF CHEOPS.  This book will be identical in size, format andcolor with MYCERINUS. It will contain 428pp. and 2 maps along with 192illustrations. The prepublication price is $85.00 (after 4/30/96:$125.00). Postage is $5.00 additional.The second title is by the Earl of Carnarvon and Howard Carter, FIVEYEARS' EXPLORATIONS AT THEBES; A RECORD OF WORK DONE 1907-1911. Thisbook will be quarto size with 100pp., 4 plans and 69 plates. It willbe bound in dark green cloth with gilt lettering. Among thediscoveries made by Carter are two stele with ex-tracts from theprecepts of Ptahhotep as well as expelling the Hyksos, many priv-atetombs and temples of Hatshepsut and Ramesses IV. The prepublicationprice is $65.00 (after 4/30/96: $95.00). Postage is $4.00 additional.For those who ordered a copy of MYCERINUS and were distressed by themis-spelling on the spine, a new label patch is available (with justthe word MYCERINUS), which can be trimmed and glued over the offendingerror. My binder recommends a PVA adhesive with neutral pH, however,he also assures me that because it is on the outside of the book,Elmer's Glue will also do the job.  Sorry for any inconvenience.John William Pye Rare Books79 Hollis Street, Brockton, Massachusetts  02402-1218 (508) 588-6566FAX: (508) 584-5338
