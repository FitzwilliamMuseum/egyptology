It is considerably larger than earlier versions (16 lessons and 300+ pages) and many rather major revisions have been made to earlier lessons. The work is, of course, still in the manuscript stage, and there are a number of gaps to be filled (i.e. no appendices, no illustrations, no key to exercises [ca. 1/2 of exercises *will* have key], etc.). The binding is cerlox (which although not elegant has practical advantages).		<p>This book is intended as a thorough introductory grammar and is not an outline of the bare essentials. The exercises are intense, but interesting. The content was chosen to encourage discussion of Egyptian literature as literature and to deal with a range of cultural questions. The grammatical approach is &quot;standard theory&quot; (&quot;Polotsky Plus&quot;).</p>		<p>A key to the exercises may be found <a href="hoch">here.</a></p>		<p>The price that I am asking for the current version is detailed below. The prices include all postage, packing, and other costs. For outside Canada, only air-mail postage is indicated (lower rates by surface can be requested). Within Canada, the price is based on first class post (ca. 1 week delivery time).</p>		<p>To the US: $35 (US$) To Canada: $40 (CDN$) To all other destinations: $40 (US$)</p>		<p>Mail to: Dr. James E. Hoch Department of Near Eastern Studies 4 Bancroft Ave. University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A1 Canada</p>		<p>You may place orders by e-mail, which will help me estimate print runs, but copies will not be sent out until the cheque or money order has been received. (This helps me keep my records straight.) Remittance must be by cheque or money order (I am not selling this commercially and cannot accept credit card orders.) Out-of-Canada orders are all fixed in US dollars--not because of any anti-Canadian sentiments!--but experience has shown that even in Commonwealth countries Canadian funds can be hard to obtain.</p>		<p>For INSTRUCTORS requesting copies for classes, please let me know the numbers expected as soon as possible. Details for class &quot;orders&quot; are negotiable, since I can send out bulk orders at surface postal rates (in time for US school year). (The base book cost is $26 US + shipping, packing, etc.) Please note: This time I am not granting general permission for instructors to reproduce my book for class-room use, but wish to supply the materials directly. (This will preclude the duplication of out-of-date versions.)</p>		<p>* For general information: This text will be published in a revised and fuller edition as a publication of the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities.</p>		<p>** The dissemination of this book is not intended as a commercial operation, but rather in order to solicit comments, criticisms, and suggestions from users (instructors, students, self-learners). Most of the comments and criticisms directed to me have been addressed. Further suggestions (and corrections) are always welcome.</p>		<p>--</p>		<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------- CampusLife - University of Toronto -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>	</body></html>
