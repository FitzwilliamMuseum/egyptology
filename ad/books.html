		Alexander Henry Rhind, a Scottish lawyer who travelled to Egypt for his health in 1855-56 and 1856-57, is probably best known for the Egyptian Mathematical Papyrus that bears his name (now preserved at the British Museum). As did many other educated Europeans who went to Egypt for medical reasons, Rhind undertook excavations in the Theban area (modern Luxor). Through his excavations and purchases, he acquired a large collection of antiquities, much of which is now in Edinburgh and still unpublished. Rhind*s book on Thebes is unique in that unlike many other Egyptologists of his time, he gives a precise and detailed description of how he actually excavated the sites, in itself an immense value to the history of archaeology.<br>
		<br>
		This edition is an exact reproduction of the 1862 first edition, and includes many coloured illustrations. (The value of the original edition in the antiquarian market averages $500.00!)<br>
