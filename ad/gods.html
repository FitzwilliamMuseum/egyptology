The five original and provocative essays that resulted<br>		engage issues as diverse as the advantages and disadvantages of polytheism;<br>		 different concepts of deity held by these closely related societies; the<br>		possibility that plural nouns may denote singular beings and vice versa; <br>		the many definitions of &quot;monotheism&quot;;  and how to decide whether an ancient<br>		author in referring to a god as &quot;one&quot; was characterizing that god as<br>		numerically singular, best in quality, or simply first to appear on the<br>		cosmic stage.  The idea was to provoke a lively exchange among four fields<br>		that currently deal with such issues in almost complete isolation from one<br>		another;  the resulting discussions at the conference, often intense, are<br>		summarized in the concluding chapter.  <br>		The volume includes essays by:<br>		John Baines, &quot;Egyptian Deities in Context:  Multiplicity, Unity, and the<br>		Problem of Change&quot;<br>		H.S. Versnel, &quot;Thrice One:  Three Greek Experiments in Oneness&quot;<br>		Simo Parpola, &quot;Monotheism in Ancient Assyria&quot;<br>		Barbara N. Porter, &quot;The Anxiety of Multiplicity:  Concepts of Divinity as<br>		One and Many in     Ancient Assyria&quot;<br>		Stephen A.
