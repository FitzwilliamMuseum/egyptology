As well as presentingnew or neglected sets of data, we hope that contributors will also beinspired to offer papers that constitute a fresh look at familiar evidencefrom a variety of theoretical viewpoints.<P>Themes that contributors are already interested in exploring range from dynastic   Egyptian uses of Egypt's own past to twentieth and twenty-first century encounters   with ancient Egypt, and include: <ul>  <li>- Egypt and Africa (e.g. interpretations of anthropological and archaeological     data; nineteenth century African-American writing; Afrocentrism) </li>  <li>- Egypt and consumption (e.g. the advertising industry; cosmetics; sensuality     and accessible luxury) </li>  <li>- Egypt as a source of literary inspiration (e.g. ancient Egypt in the modern     Egyptian novel; travelogues; nineteenth century periodical fiction) </li>  <li>- Egypt in the visual and performing arts (e.g. opera, ballet, film, the     tv documentary; the art of Alma Tadema, Edwin Long, Edward Poynter) - Egypt     as a source of awe (e.g. technical/arcane knowledge; mummification; medicine     and magic; alternative religion) </li>  <li>- Egypt's heritage reconstructed (e.g. tomb-robbery; politics of collection     and display; pilgrimage/tourism) </li>  <li>- Egypt in education (e.g. ancient Egypt on the Net; the National Curriculum;     non-Eurocentrist education) </li></ul><P>The sessions will be devoted entirely to discussion. All papers will bepre-circulated, using e-mail where possible. The chairs of sessions areeach providing a positional paper, which will be made available with thesecond circular. Participants are invited to submit (preferably by e-mail)a paper of any length up to 10,000 words by 31st July 2000 for circulationin August.<P>It is hoped that the conference will be linked to a touring exhibition,drawn from the Institute of Archaeology's Petrie Museum of EgyptianArchaeology, which will explore related themes.<P>If you would like to receive the second circular, with details ofRegistration, sessions, fees, and accommodation, please contact theorganizers now, preferably at the conference e-mail address:ancient-egypt@ucl.ac.uk<P>Dominic MontserratDepartment of Classics and Ancient History, University of Warwick, England<P>John TaitInstitute of Archaeology, UCL, England<P>e-mail: ancient-egypt@ucl.ac.uk <P>Postal address: "Encounters with Ancient Egypt Conference", Institute of Archaeology,   University College London, 31-34 Gordon Square, GB - London WC1H 0PY, England </BODY></HTML>
