<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<b>THE EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF EGYPTOLOGISTS</b>
<p>
<b></b></p><p>
February 3, 2000</p><p>
</p><p>
Dear Colleague,</p><p>
This final announcement has been delayed by the sudden change in venue for the
Congress of Egyptologists. Because of an African-European Presidential meeting
at the Cairo International Conference Centre, we have been obliged to move to
<b>THE</b> <b>MENA HOUSE OBEROI</b> in Giza. All the meetings of the Congress
will now take place there. The dates have not changed.</p><p>
We apologize for the inconvenience that this will cause, but we are sure that
the new venue will, in fact, be an enhancement. The Mena House has wonderful
facilities and restaurants, expert staff and a beautiful garden (to say nothing
of the surroundings). 
</p><h2>
<a name="RTFToC1">Millennium
Lectures and Debates
</a></h2>
To celebrate the millennium, each day of the Congress will begin with a
Millenium Lecture (two on the last day) on different aspects of Egyptology. The
subjects of these keynote topics are: Archaeology, Site Management and
Protection, Museology, Language, Literature, Religion and Art. Each lecture
will be followed by a debate between invited scholars.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Papers
</a></h2>
The response to the call for papers was very good,<b> </b>and we have had to
limit delegates to one paper each. <b><u>The maximum time for communication is
25 minutes, including discussion</u></b>. <b>This time limit will be strictly
enforced in order to keep the parallel sessions in line</b>  Please make sure
that your paper does not exceed this limit.<p>
<b>Limited Numbers</b> </p><p>
The availability of rooms at The Mena House has meant that the number of
delegates will be limited.  Those who intend to pay on arrival but have not yet
registered with the Congress Office should register their names as soon as
possible on the form below. We can only guarantee places for registered
delegates. Only payments in cash will be accepted now (no cheques or credit
cards) at the Congress Office, Documentation Centre, Zamalek, and during the
Congress at The Mena House (Full $200, Student, with proof of status, $60).
</p><h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Projectors
</a></h2>
All rooms<b> </b>will be equipped with a 35mm slide projector. There will also
be an overhead projector available (for transparent originals only). It is not
possible to arrange for dual projection during the ordinary sessions. If you
require other equipment, please inquire at the Congress Office before March
1<sup>st</sup>.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Early
Registration 
</a></h2>
Delegates can register before the Congress starts at the <b>Documentation
Centre, Zamalek</b> (1<sup>st</sup> floor, next to the Office of the Secretary
General) on <b>Sunday March 26<sup>th</sup></b> from 10.00am to 4.00pm and at
<b>The Mena House</b> <b>Oberoi</b> on <b>Monday March 27<sup>th</sup></b> from
10.00am to 4.00pm and from 8.00 to 10.00 am on <b>Tuesday March
28<sup>th</sup></b>. The registration desk will be open throughout the Congress
for late arrivals<b>. <u>If you have paid by bank transfer, you must bring your
bank transfer confirmation or receipt with you as proof of payment</u></b>.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Name
Badges
</a></h2>
<u>All delegates will receive a name badge that should be worn at all times
during the Congress and at official receptions</u>, and a Congress Package
containing the abstracts volume, the final lecture programme, invitations to
Official and Institutional receptions and information about Cairo.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Hotels</a></h2>
There are a certain number of rooms available in the Mena House, and there are
many other hotel in the Giza area. <b>Emeco Travel</b> has details and will
make bookings upon request. <p>
<b>Travel</b> </p><p>
As stated in the last announcement, <b>Egyptair</b> is offering discounts to
congress delegates; 25% on excursion fares and 50% on ordinary fares; up to 75%
for groups of 10 or more coming from Europe or the USA when booked through the
official Congress Travel Agent, <b>Emeco Travel</b>,<b> </b>(see details
below). <u>Please remember to bring your return tickets to the Congress Travel
Desk to re-confirm your departure</u>.</p><p>
<b>Visas</b> </p><p>
You must have a valid visa to enter Egypt. Please check with the Egyptian
Consulate of your own country about requirements. 
</p><h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">Transport
in Cairo: Airport
</a></h2>
The baggage trolleys at the airport cost LE2.00. Outside the airport,
limousines are available for c.LE50-70 depending on destination (the white
limousines have English-speaking drivers but the black ones are cheaper). Taxis
are slightly cheaper, but may haggle about the price. Emeco Travel offers a
`meet and assist' service to meet people off the plane, to assist them with
visas, passport control, customs and to take them to their destination. <u>Do
not accept assistance from unauthorized persons or drivers.</u><p>
<u></u><b>Taxis</b> </p><p>
Taxis in Cairo are black and white, cheap and plentiful. They don't use the
meter as the official rate is unrealistic. A short journey within central Cairo
will cost between LE3-5; longer ones proportionally more. From. Zamalek to the
Mena House will be about LE 25-30 and will take about 25-30 minutes via the new
western ring road from Agouza/Mohandessin to Giza. The eastern ring road is now
connected with Giza via the Mouneeb bridge; Maadi to Mena House takes about 30
minutes and costs about LE25-30. Hotel taxis will be more expensive. 
</p><h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Climate
 
</a></h2>
The weather should be mild and sunny during the day, but may still be chilly in
the evening and early mornings, requiring light jackets and pullovers. For the
tours, you should bring the usual sun protection - hat, sun screen, etc.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">Changing
Money
</a></h2>
Most hotels have foreign exchange bureaux for the major European and North
American currencies, travellers cheques and Eurocheques.<p>
<b>Credit Cards</b></p><p>
American Express, Visa and MasterCard are accepted quite widely in shops and
restaurants. Visa and MasterCard can be used for cash advance in some banks as
well as Thomas Cook offices.</p><p>
<b>Telephones</b></p><p>
<b></b>International calling cards (ATT, Sprint, MCI, etc...) can be used at
five-star hotels. </p><p>
<b>Tax Free Goods</b></p><p>
<b></b>As well as the usual duty-free allowance on entering the country,
Egyptian law permits an additional duty free allowance if purchased within
24-hours of arrival. There are tax-free shops at the airport (outside customs),
in Mohandessin, Maadi and the City Centre. </p><p>
<b>Electronic Goods</b></p><p>
<b></b>If you are bringing in electronic goods such as computers and videos it
is wise to have them recorded in your passport on your arrival. They must then
accompany you out of the country again or you may be charged tax on them.</p><p>
<b>Electricity</b></p><p>
<b></b>The electric current in Egypt is 220V AC, 50 HZ. If necessary, you
should bring adapter plugs and travel size transformers, as they are difficult
to obtain in Egypt.</p><p>
<b>Tipping</b></p><p>
<b></b>It is advisable to keep a good supply of small change. In hotels and
restaurants it is usual to give between 10-12% of the bill. Porters and taxi
drivers also expect tips. </p><p>
