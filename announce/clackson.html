Clackson Coptic Fund from overseas:</h3>		<p>The most effective way of contributing for Americans is to make payment<br>		through the American Friends of Oxford by using our 'Gift Form for US<br>		Residents', which can be found at:<br>		<a href="http://www.development.ox.ac.uk/webimages/us.pdf">http://www.development.ox.ac.uk/webimages/us.pdf</a> . After 'allocated to the<br>		University', donors need to write in: 'for the Sarah J. Clackson Coptic<br>		Fund'. Please send this form to Oxford's North American Office in New York<br>		City (the address is given on the form).<br>		<br>		People donating in euros should just send cheques, or make transfers to the<br>		university's bank account. Do not worry about bank charges, because the<br>		university will just absorb them into its overall bank payments; there is a<br>		small loss on the currency conversion, but we cannot do anything about that<br>		(and at least the euro is strong!). With bank transfers there is a line for<br>		'purpose' or something similar, and on that line people should put 'Sarah J.<br>		Clackson Coptic Fund', or, if that is too many characters for the available<br>		space, simply 'Clackson Coptic Fund' will still be unambiguous.<br>		<br>		Account Name: University of Oxford Development Trust<br>		Account Number: 4015586<br>		Sort Code: 20-65-20<br>		Account Address: Barclays Bank, Oxford City Centre Branch, PO Box 333,<br>		Cornmarket Street, Oxford, OX1 3HS<br>	</body></html>
