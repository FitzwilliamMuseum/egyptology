31st January, 2000EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF EGYPTOLOGISTS28 March ö 3 April 2000We are obliged to announce a change in venue for the EighthInternational Congress of Egyptologists.The sudden announcement of an African-European Presidential meeting atthe Cairo International Conference Centre at the beginning of Aprilmeans that this location is no longer available to us. Happily, THE MENAHOUSE OBEROI at the Pyramids has come to our rescue, and all themeetings of the Congress will now take place there. The dates have notchanged.We apologize for the inconvenience that this will cause, but we are surethat the new venue will, in fact, be an enhancement. The Mena House haswonderful facilities and restaurants, expert staff and a beautifulgarden. The Congress will now be held in the shadow of the most famousmonument in Egypt.There are a certain number of guest rooms available in the Mena House,and there are many other hotel in the Giza area. Emeco Travel hasdetails and will make bookings upon request.The third and final announcement of the Congress will be sent outshortly, to be followed by a more detailed programme of the schedule ofpapers to be published on the Internet.We understand that many delegates intend to pay the registration feeupon arrival in Cairo. Those who have not yet registered are requestedto do so immediately with the Congress Office. This will ensure a placeat the Congress and avoid disappointment.Zahi Hawass,Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Eighth InternationalCongress of Egyptologists
