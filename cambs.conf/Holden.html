<h1>A New Light on Ancient Art: Using Computers to Understand Traditional Cultures</h1>

<h2>Lynn Holden</h2>

What is it about ancient Egypt, its culture and particularly its art, which has
universal appeal and strikes a deep and familiar chord within us, even in this
amazing modern age? <p>

How can what we learn about this primal culture, distantly removed in time and
space, help us understand and cope with our own lives as individuals, members
of society and global citizens in a rapidly changing world?<p>

Artforms are key elements which display the brilliance and strengths of every
people. Sometimes they are highly stylized in unfamiliar ways, requiring some
interpretation, but often just the understanding of the original intention and
perspective of the creators will show that they were concerned with the same
fundamental issues as we are today. It is true that there are always
differences of language, environmental influences and local customs, but, the
fact remains that the essential concerns of most humans, throughout history,
have always been much more similar than different.<p>

We wonder; who are we, where have we come from, and where are we going? We all
go through the same developments and transitions in our lives; birth, growth,
joinings and separations, reproduction and eventually passing on to something
beyond, which we cannot know before its time comes.<p>

The ancient Egyptians evolved extraordinary ways of expressing their
understanding of the wonder of the cycles of life (creation) and death
(destruction). It is the surety, clarity and directness of their artforms and
cultural expressions that strikes the common chord and appeals to latent needs
within all of us. <p>

The inspiration of the forms of their art and architecture mirror the beauty
and harmony of their relationship with nature. Similarly the details of their
reliefs and domestic artifacts reflect a rich appreciation of the joy of
earthly life, which they wished to extend beyond the threshold of death.<p>

Their cultural artforms display a sensitive design aesthetic and confidence of
craftsmanship which derive from a long association with the regular cycles of
their unique Nilotic environment and the equilibrium of its natural forces. The
power of these artworks lie in their functional significance as conveyors of
cultural tradition and symbolic meaning.<p>

The ITeN (Interactive Teaching Network) Disk Project being developed at the
College of Fine Arts of Carnegie Mellon University is inspired by work begun
during the installation of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History's Walton Hall
of Ancient Egypt. <p>

A computer information/reference system was installed in the gallery to supply
additional information to complement the exhibition labels and graphics, to
increase the density of knowledge available in the immediate proximity of the
artifacts, and thus the potential impact on visitors. A high quality videodisc
also provides ten 5 minute scripted presentations on the central themes of the
exhibition. <p>

We are now extending these ideas into the educational arena. There need to be
created new interactive hypermedia systems to engage students, teachers and
interested people with the critical achievements of historic cultures. These
materials are intended to support new curricula in the College and University,
but could also be accessible to any interested person.<p>

Our approach at the College is to use the computer to link discrete knowledge
sources in meaningful ways and to allow multiple accesses via different
pathways according to the perspective and interests of the user. Within the
highly sophisticated computer environment we use an interface design format
based on the aesthetic of the culture being explored. This engages the user in
the perspective of cultures distantly removed in space and time. <p>

Emphasis is on recontextualizing artifacts and visualizing original contexts,
with the assistance of virtual reconstructions. In this way we can use finite
sources of data, such as moving images on videodisc, digitized still images and
details, digital sound and ancient text translations and modern analyses and
commentaries (on CD-ROM) to enrich considerably the educational impact of an
object or image being looked at.<p>

Our interactive learning environment will use three pathways to access the data
on ancient Egypt: <p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>General Pathway</b> <p>
will allow/allows/ the user with broad ranging interests and no academic
background (General Museum Visitor, K-12 level) to view scripted 5-6 minute
videodisc presentations on the ten most popular subjects about ancient Egypt;
<b>the Nile, Daily Life, Art, Science, Temples, Pyramids, the Sphinx, Tombs,
Mummies and Modern Egypt.</b><p>

<li>The <b>Academic Pathway</b> <p>
will present/presents/ materials that a humanities student would need to
master in college. These materials focus on the traditional disciplines:
<b>Language, Culture, History, Economy and Science</b>, with links to extended
resources such as; <b>Bibliographies, Time Lines, King Lists, Maps</b>, etc.,
as well as to on-line libraries and other external networked educational
institutions. <p>

<li>The <b>Fine Arts Pathway</b> <p>
will consider/considers the perspective of the visual (studio) artist and
provides access to the knowledge sources according to the disciplines of the
College of Fine Arts; <b>Art, Design, Architecture, Drama and Music</b>. Within
any discipline the user can move down three to five successive choice levels
relating to; <b>Medium, Materials, Styles and Techniques, Time Periods</b> and
ultimately to specific sites, objects and individuals.<p>

</ul>

At the end of any presentation the viewer can cross over to the other pathways
to explore subjects from other perspectives, or move into a synthesis-study
area where specific monuments, artifacts or individuals can be looked at in
greater detail and be related to maps, time lines, texts and other associated
materials.<p>

Additional elements to be developed for this learning system include an
Egyptocentric experience which would allow seeing materials organized from the
ancient culture's point of view, relative to their notion of the most
significant themes. There will also be use assessment and printout/copy
elements to the system.<p>

We are experimenting using actual real-time video-walkthroughs of the surviving
ruins of major sites, complemented by virtual walkthroughs of data-CAD
reconstructed simulations of the original structures to recontextualize
fragments and objects spread around the world in museums and collections back
to their original locations. Eventually we hope to animate the most important
scenes of events and activities, so that the monuments themselves can "tell
their story" directly, with animate Egyptian images accompanied by running
translations of their hieroglyphic inscriptions.<p>

Ultimately the ITeN hypermedia system will be a richly integrated flexible,
multidisciplinary exploration tool whose concept can be adapted to any historic
culture. Egypt was chosen because of the extraordinary quality and quantity of
its visual artforms, but also for its unique global situation, being linked
geographically and intellectually to both Western Civilization (Greece, Rome
&amp; Europe) and Eastern Culture (Mesopotamia, India, China &amp; Japan).<p>

This system can become a new type of multidimensional resource for libraries
and institutional and inter-institutional information networks. It is our
intention with the ITeN interactive teaching system to use the threads of
commonality and the tensions between modern and ancient perceptions to
stimulate active learning modes within the critical thinking processes and make
learning about traditional cultures and art both enjoyable and stimulating.<p>

All of this is in anticipation of the cyberspace studio/classroom of the not so
distant future, where visitors, students and teachers will enter into virtual
recreations of ancient space and time to personally experience and learn about
the amazing achievements of great historic civilizations, such as those of
ancient Egypt.
