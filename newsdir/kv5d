Ralph Conde Jr reports the following:Kent Weeks was on the National Public Radio, this morning, from Cairo. Heanswered questions from a national phone-in audience.  The following aresome of his comments.Unlike the normal 19th Dynasty tombs, which generally run straight backinto the bedrock, this tomb has chambers going off in every direction,"like tentacles of an octopus."  He said KV5 is the only known familymausoleum discovered, and wondered is there may be more yet to be found.He said that most chambers had flood damage.  He said that the SCA wasclearing KV7 (Ramesses II tomb) in order to open it to the public in thefuture, and he hoped that they would open KV5 as well.  He said that itcontains a large number of fragmentary articles, including mummy fragmentsof young adult males.  Up to now only the names of 4 of Ramesses sons havebeen found in tomb.  In July he will return to the tomb for engineeringwork, and then resume excavation in mid September.
