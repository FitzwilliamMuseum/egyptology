What itdoes not tell you is the condition of the first large hypostyle room,before the entrance to the corridor with twenty offering chapels(?).The columns are fractured and, when I was there, the room was filled withlimestone debris close to the ceiling. Once you crawl through that space,it is possble to almost stand and walk down the corridor with rooms facingeach other on both sides. At the point with the engaged Osiris statue,the corridor branches at right angles but I thought there were descendingpassages, not stairs, leading to the lower level Kent expects to find.Kent is concerned with the condition of columns, walls and ceilings becausepart of the tomb complex is located under what used to be the bus parkingarea and there are engineering problems, as one might expect, which haveto be solved before excavation can be taken as far as one might like.There is a lot of fragmentary relief, mainly in the plaster coat, lefton the walls and probably much more to come in the debris levels below.Where the plaster is gone, there is some indication of the decoration wherethe incision went though to the limestone.  As to the plan, all I can sayis that it looks like a dormitory arrangement, and does not resemble the planof any royal tomb. Some of the members of the Brooklyn/Detroit excavationsat the Precinct of Mut were lucky to have seen KV5 in March. Kent Weeksgraciously allowed collegues to visit and I am glad that the news hasfinally been announced.   Congratulations Kent!========================================================================WILLIAM H.
