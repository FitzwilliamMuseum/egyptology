What is unusual about thisinscription, claims Dirk "Bubba" MacGuire, graduate student in electricalengineering at the University of Alabama, is its repetitive  "sing-song"composition.	"We have many dedicatory inscriptions in Demotic," explained MacGuire," butnone that repeat the inscriber's name three times -- twice in succession." Other unusual aspects of this graffito are the use of the title after thepersonal name, as well as its boastful oratory apparently attributing thephysical strength of the inscriber, a river pilot named Pepwy, to hisvegetarian diet.	"Such claims regarding an exclusive diet of plants are almost unheard of inthe ancient world," stated MacGuire.  	While he still has some reservations about the readings of some of the words,MacGuire provided the following provisional translation of the inscription: "Pepwy, the man who sails am I.  Pepwy the man who sails am I.  It is while Iam eating my vegetables, that I am strong to the ends (of the earth).  Pepwy,the man who sails am I."  The name of the subject of the graffito is mysteriousin that it is not a common Egyptian name. MacGuire speculates that the name maybe Carian.  The Carians were a seafaring people from Asia Minor some of whomsettled in Egypt after its conquest by Alexander the Great. REUTERReut09:43 09-28Reuter N:Copyright 1994, Reuters News Service..
