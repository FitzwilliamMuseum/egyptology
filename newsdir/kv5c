In reply to the recent postings regarding KV5....I was one of the lucky ones to have been inside the tomb;I was a member of Dr. Weeks' team in the summer of 1994.While I was there, Egyptian workers had found the firsthallway which stretches back to the statue of Osiris.Catharine Roehrig and I had dared each other to crawlinto one of the smaller chambers to the right - but theopening was so small we couldn't imagine being able toget back out once inside. The tomb _is_ as described inone post - literally full to the ceiling with limestonedebris from flooding. You really have to crawl aroundin this one to see anything ! There are some roomswere the mud had settled and you can kind of stand/slouch;but for the most part this is impossible. In the firsttwo rooms at the entrance the ceiling is badly damaged and falling in some places; the columns are there, but many are damaged and probably would not be able to holdthe weight of the ceiling as they once did. Lots ofdifficult engineering and structural problems to dealwith... I had a great time last year, and I am very proud toeven have played a minor role in documenting thetomb. Congrats again to Dr. Weeks, a remarkablefind ! Thanks for giving me the chance to work withyou...kharyssa rhodes____________________ISSOAR@grog.ric.edu
