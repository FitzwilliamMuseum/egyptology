<H1>Tomb of Alexander the Great at Siwa ?</H1>

<P>This document collects together interesting snippets of
information, about this purported "find" arranged in most recent
first order. To return to the Egyptology Home Page click <A HREF="http://www.newton.ac.uk/egypt/">here</A>.</P>

The May/June 1995 issue of Archaeology carried an article by Bob
Bianchi debunking the whole story as a well-orchestrated political
move by Souvaltzi to fulfill a "prophecy" that, if a Greek secured
Alexander's body, Greece would no longer be forced to share the
designation of their province of Macedonia with Skopje, a province of
the former Yugoslavia! (courtesy Bill Walsh).

10 Feb 95: the following was posted to the Chicago list:<p></P>

<P>I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Siwa
inscription naming Alexander and poison is a fraud. It does not
exist. The Greek delegates from the Ministry of Culture saw a
dedicatory inscription written on an architrave of a building from
the reign of Trajan. It named Artemidoros, eparch of Egypt. There was
no Alexander and no tomb.</P>

07/02/95: The plot thickens. Ogden Goelet posted <A HREF="alex2">this
cautionary article from the New York Times</A> as to whether the tomb
is really what people say it is.<p></P>

06/02/95: Charles E. Jones posted this to the Chicago list:<p></P>

<P>Liana Souvaltzi reported at the 6th International Congress of
Egyptology in Turin in 1991 on a Macedonian tomb in Siwa oasis:</P>

<P>"Discovering a Macedonian Tomb in Siwa Oasis" In: Curto, Silvio et
al., &#91;Editors&#93;, Sesto Congresso Internazionale di
Egittologia: Atti, Volume II (1993), pages 511-514.</P>

<P>Is this the same tomb we're talking about this week?</P>

<P>(end Jones)</P>

<P>Nicole B. Hansen posted the following interesting quote to the
Chicago list:</P>

<P>In Cassandra Vivian's 1990 book _Islands of the Blest: A Guide to
the Oases and Western Desert of Egypt_, she describes the area where
the tomb was found (Maraqi), thus:</P>

<P>"Little remains of the Doric Temple described by travelers in the
nineteenth century as a perfect Doric structure. The temple is
presently being excavated by a Greek Mission that hopes to find
information about Alexander the Great in the rubble. The hypothesis
is that Alexander is buried in Siwa, and the temple, being the only
existing Greek structure, will offer clues to support the theory. To
date no inscriptions or artifacts have been found."-p.283</P>

<P>5 years ago, before finding anything, she believed they would find
the tomb! We all know how Schliemann wanted to find Troy...</P>

<P>(end Hansen).</P>

03/02/95: The fullest information so far comes from an AP feature
posted on the net, which may be the same as a New York Times article
spotted on 2/2/95. Click <A HREF="alex1"> here </A> to see this.<p></P>

<P>Erhart Graefe has sent an interesting article on the subject from
the <A HREF="frank-alex">Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung</A> (in
German).</P>

<P>

</p><HR />

30/1/95: Bruce Williams posted to the Chicago list a Reuter report
about a recent intriguing find at Siwa. This was followed by another
report posted by Chuck Jones on 1/2/95. Click <A HREF="alex">here</A>
to see these reports.<p></P>

<P>Anton Koornhof (antonij@asiaonline.net) tells me that the
excavation is by a team of Greek archaeologists under Liana
Souvaltzi. The excavations have apparently been put on hold for a
month as Ramadan has started.</P>
