Notice of Gallery ClosureThe Ashmolean regrets that the Egyptian Dynastic Gallery, with exhibitsranging from the early Dynastic period through to Coptic, will be closedfrom Tuesday 12 September 2000. This is to enable a major reinstallationto be carried out, and we expect the closure to last for at least 12months.  The material housed in the gallery (both on show and in reserve) will needto be stored and so will not be available for viewing or study during thistime. Amongst the categories affected are finds from the Royal Tombs atAbydos, and small to medium-sized objects from excavated sites, OldKingdom to Ptolemaic. The other Egyptian galleries will be open as usual, and selected objectsfrom the Dynastic displays, including the Hierakonpolis maceheads andpalette, will be on view in a temporary arrangement. While the reinstallation is in progress, we will be able to provide only alimited service for enquiries and visits: contactantiquities@ashmus.ox.ac.uk with any specific queries. Information onguided tours and study activities for children and adults is availablefrom the museumâs Education Service, 9.00-13.00 daily:  (0)1865 278015[tel.], 288192 [fax] ; education.service@ashmus.ox.ac.uk . The Dynastic Egypt reinstallation has been funded by the Dr Mortimer andTheresa Sackler Foundation, and the gallery will henceforth be known asThe Sackler Gallery Of Egyptian Antiquities. We hope that you will enjoyvisiting it when the work is completed.News updates and general information about the museum can be found on ourweb site, www.ashmol.ox.ac.uk
