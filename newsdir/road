EducationalScientific and Cultural Organization) complained the highwayviolated a world cultural and natural heritage convention.         President Hosni Mubarak has since ordered work on theeight-lane road to stop while planners seek an alternative.         Abdelhalim Noreddin, chairman of the Supreme AntiquitiesCouncil, told Reuters Wednesday that preliminary excavationsjust south of the highway had turned up at least eight tombsdating probably from the six centuries before Christ.         ``It looks like part of a big cemetery. We have anecropolis, maybe from between the 26th Dynasty and thePtolemaic period,'' he said.         The tombs contained some everyday objects, small coffins andunusual small statues wrapped up as mummies, possibly connectedwith the funerary gods Osiris and Sokar, he said.         Other wooden statues found in the tombs, also very unusual,have large erect phalluses but their purpose is not clear.         One archeologist said he thought they were symbolic ofresurrection, another that they symbolized fertility.         The necropolis stands on the plateau running between theGiza pyramids in the north and the less well-known pyramids ofDahshour about 17 miles to the south.         The whole strip of desert is listed as a world heritage siteunder the convention and in theory there are severe restrictionson what can be built there.         Said Zulficar, director of operational activities in thecultural heritage division of UNESCO, visited the plateau inNovember and was horrified to find work well advanced on thehighway, part of a ring road around Cairo.         He also reported that the site contained a factory, rubbishdumps, military installations and a new complex to house 15,000people, all in violation of an Egyptian law passed in 1983 towin world heritage status.         A ministerial committee on alternatives to the highway metin Cairo Sunday and Culture Minister Farouk Hosni was quoted assaying highway planners would use a road which runs parallel tothe Nile and well outside the protected area.         They may also build a road into the desert south ofDahshour, also outside the area. This would link up, like thedisputed road, with highways to the provincial cities ofAlexandria and Fayoum.         Noreddin said UNESCO would send some experts of its own tostudy the possible routes and he declined to say what he thoughtwould be the fate of the half-built highway.         ``I understand they are postponing a decision on the rightroute until UNESCO comes,'' he said.         In a resolution passed Dec. 17, UNESCO's World HeritageCommittee said the encroachments on the plateau seriouslythreatened the integrity of the site and would do irreparabledamage if they continued.         ``The committee requested the Egyptian authorities to takethe necessary measures to halt these different activities and torepair the damage already caused without delay,'' it added.
