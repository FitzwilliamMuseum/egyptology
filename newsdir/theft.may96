EGYPTIAN DELEGATION IN LONDON TO COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS INTOSMUGGLING OF RARE ANTIQUITIES COLLECTION"This may be the most serious theft of Egyptian antiquities in thetwentieth century". This was the description used by Egyptian Ministerof Culture Farouk Hosni to characterize case no. 391 for 1995 which isnow being completed in London where an Egyptian security-judicialdelegation arrived recently to follow up on developments in thissensational case. Involved are twenty English witnesses each of whomobtained one.or more original papyruses smuggled from warehouse number8 in the Sakkara antiquities zone. Some of those came into possessionof marvelous Pharaonic scenes engraved in rock and taken from theHoteb tomb. These make a unique antiquities collection lost to Egyptthat is now trying to return it through Interpol.Those people charged in connection with this case number elevenincluding highly-placed Egyptian antiquities officials and threeBritons: Jonathan Tokley, Mark Leslie and Andrew Man. The latterconfessed that Tokley is the original smuggler of Egyptianantiquities. Leslie was the middleman in this operation.Andrew Man is a leading dealer in antiquities and archaeologist whobought 27 papyruses he knew to be stolen. But his anxiety to ascertainthat they were genuine and not fakes led to his being exposed. In May1994 he went to the Egyptology department of the British Museum tohave the papyruses checked and it was established that they are reallyoriginal but it was also established that they were stolen from theSakkara warehouse in Egypt.For two years a British officer, Charles Ellis, from the department ofinternational crime at Scotlandyard managed to follow the leads of thecrime to disclose very sensational details. According to the filereaching the Egyptian Ministry of Justice, the Egyptian defendantsused a privately-owned workshops engaged in imitating originalantiquities to make covers for the original pieces to be smuggled inorder to look faked (non-original). This made it easy to smuggle themthrough the Luxor airport which is considered the main gateway for thesmuggling of antiquities because of its proximity to the antiquitiesareas in southern Egypt. Security is weak in that airport and there isa lack of archaeological experts at its customs checkpoints. This isthe same airport from which three Egyptians recently hijacked a planeand then surrendered to the Libyan authorities.In the way, members of the gang managed from September 16, 1990, toJuly 20, 1991, to saw out large parts of the Hoteb tomb which has beenused to store finds from archaeological sites. They then smuggled themas fakes to shops selling imitation of Egyptian antiquities inBritain, Germany and Switzerland. The English gang collected thesepieces to make them a unique collection of Egyptian relics which alsoincluded 182 yellow papyruses each of which is four thousand years oldor even more. It was one of these that the British Museum identifiedas original and this led the way to the exposure of the theft of therest of the pieces that have been stolen, or their theft fabricated,by an Egyptian gang led by the owner of an Arab bazaar owner calledIbrahim Farag.Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni told Al-Hayat that he has referredthe whole file to the prosecution for investigations. Everyone who hadany connection with this serious case will be suspended in theperformance of his duties. Security organs are now conductingmeticulous checks of the files of archaeologists working in areas ofantiquities to prevent a repetition of this tragedy caused byEgyptians who smuggled important papers of Egypt's Pharaonichistory. Hosni said that those implicated will be put on trial inCairo.Meanwhile, the Egyptian Minister of Justice, Farouk Saif Al-Nasr,formed a delegation consisting of councillor Medhat Al-Attar, generalattorney of the Prosecution of Public Funds, Lashin Ibrahim, head ofthat prosecution, and a number of police officers from the policedepartments of antiquities and public funds to look into theinvestigations' files compiled by Scotlandyard.  An official judiciarysource told Al-Hayat that the delegation will ask for impounding ofthe seized papyruses and seek an understanding with the British sideto find the rest of the stolen antiquities collections for returningthem to Egypt which notified Interpol of the numbers of the relics andthe papyruses for seizing them in the important auction halls inLondon and Paris and with the antiquities dealers in some Europeancountries.  Al-Hayat, 2/5/1996
