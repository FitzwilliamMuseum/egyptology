The arrests followed a nine-month joint investigation with Egyptian authorities, codenamedOperation Bullrush.   Egyptian police officials traveled recently to London, then said the ring included Egyptian officials, businessmen, antiquities inspectors, a college professor and others.   Egyptian and British police are negotiating details of the return of the ^Mallegedly stolen goods from Britain to Egypt.    Copyright 1995 The United Press International
