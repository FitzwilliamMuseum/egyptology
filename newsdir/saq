From: C-reuters@clarinet.com (Reuter / Jonathan Wright)Subject: Archeologists find tombs of prominent EgyptiansDate: Thu, 20 Oct 94 9:30:17 PDT         CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) - Archeologists have found the tombsof two Egyptians who died about 2300 BC, director of excavationsAli Hassan said  Thursday.         Both tombs, in the Saqqara necropolis about 12 miles southof Cairo, are in good condition, with paint still visible on thehieroglyphic inscriptions and on a mural showing people bearingofferings, he said.         ``They're the first for at least 10 years at Saqqara tocontain such an amount of objects, and some of them could bemuseum pieces,'' he told Reuters.         Saqqara was the burial ground for the pharaohs who ruled atnearby Memphis, by legend the first capital of united Egypt. Ithas the first pyramid, the Step Pyramid of Zozer.         The tombs, including the debris which covered them fromlater centuries, contained wooden statues, several sarcophagi,well-preserved baskets with alabaster cosmetic jars and parts ofwhat is probably a palanquin from about 1400 BC.         One of them belonged to Ka Aper, who described himself as``the one well-known to the Pharaoh, the hereditary prince, thehead of the archives of the Pharaoh and the head of all works inthe vicinity of the Pharaoh Teti's pyramid.''         ``He was a sixth dynasty priest but his name is completelynew to us. We didn't know he existed. We've added a new verydistinguished person to the history books,'' Hassan said.         The other tomb belonged to a priestess and is a very rareexample of an Old Kingdom tomb built solely for a woman. At thattime dead women were usually depicted only on the walls of theirhusbands' tombs, he added.         ``Her name was Najad Pet, the gift of the gods, and she wasthe priestess of the goddess Hathor, of the goddess Neith of theDelta and of the god Wepwawet, the jackal who opens the way forthe dead,'' he said.         ``We found chambers of mud brick covered with plaster andpainted with very fine scenes of offering bearers with beautifulgarlands. The color is still there,'' he added.         Hassan said the tombs had been robbed in ancient times butthere was still a chance they would find the sarcophagus of KaAper intact at a lower level.
