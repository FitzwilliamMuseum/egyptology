This is mostly because it is difficult to piece together what actually happened.</P>  <ul><P><i>As regards the events of that day from our perspective, we were working on Sheikh Abd elQurna, right beside the tomb of Sennefer.  At about 9.15, our workmenbegan to be alarmed by rumours of some trouble at Deir el Bahari.  At9.30, one of our men went round there and came back very distraught bywhat he had seen.  It gradually became clear that something serioushad happened.  We continued working until about 11.00, when weheard gunfire from the direction of Deir el Medina.  At this point, wegave up and went back to our hotel.</i></P></ul><P>The following is the closest we havebeen able to get to the facts about what actually happened.  It isbuilt up from talking to the inspectorsthere and to other local people who saw some of it for themselves.</P><P>At about 9 am, agroup of gunmen, disguised as police, entered the temple at Deir elBahari, following two large groups of tourists.  Two stayed at theentrance, while the other four followed the groups up the first rampand on to the terrace.  Once there, they opened fire on the tourists,while the two at the gate shot the tourist policemen and a guard.<P><P>What happened next becomes less clear, but it seems that at some pointthey tried to make off to the south, using an Isis Travel bus, either down the main road, or possibly across the sand.  While the shootingat the temple was going on, word went out that the police were needed,and those in the Valley of the Kings were apparently seen running overthe hills towards Deir el Bahari.  And word seems to have been passedthat the gunmen were heading south, towards the Valley of the Queens.</P><P>At this point, the roads around the Valley of the Queens, Deir elMedina and Medinet Habu were closed off.  The gunmen seem to have abandoned the bus at some point and run off on foot, possibly because they saw the police had closed in around them, or possibly because the police actually started shooting at the bus.  In either case, this wasprobably the shooting we heard from the Deir el Medina direction.</P><P>Some reports have spoken of a two to three hour gun battle with theterrorists.  We certainly didn't hear anything of that kind, but wemay only have heard the final denoument.  The local people were so outraged by what had happened that, it is said, they had to be restrained from tearing the bodies of the gunmen to pieces and burningthe bodies.</P><P>The road to Deir el Bahari was left open to traffic, presumably toenable the emergency vehicles to get there as quickly as possible.Ambulances were going up and down to the site for most of the rest of the day, taking people to the small hospital near the Seti temple forfirst aid or over the river.  Otherwise, all was relatively quiet.</P><P>On the following day, it was pretty well business as usual.  Touristbuses were around, including visits to Deir el Bahari on theiritineraries.  President Mubarak flew in, and for that period we had soldiers on the top of Sheikh Abd el Qurna.  After his departure, theytoo were gone.</P><P>The local population is in deep shock, and this is of a genuinenature.  Obviously, there is the concern that the tourist trade isgoing to be ruined; but beyond that, people are appalled that thiscould happen not only in their country, but in Luxor, and carried outby Egyptians.</P><P>Helen Strudwick</P></body></html>
