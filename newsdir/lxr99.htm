The new director, Dr Mohamed Nasr, is taking previously unseen objects out of magazines on both sides of the river, and it is hoped that he will be able to include a number of the objects discovered recently in the area.</p>		<p>The SCA is continuing conservation work in the main temples on the West Bank.</p>		<p>Missions who have been working here while we are in TT99:</p>		<p><b>German Archaeological Institute</b>: in Dra Abul Naga, under the direction of Daniel Polz. They have been finishing off the large tomb of Ramessesnakht near the top of the hill, which itself might be that of a 17th or early 18th dynasty king. Adjacent to this they have found two further New Kingdom tombs, one of which might just be of the High Priest of Amun of the early years of Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten.</p>		<p><b>Amarna Royal Tombs Project, UK</b>: Nicholas Reeves and Geoffrey Martin left just as we arrived, but they have dug a very deep trench into the Valley of the Kings between the tombs of Tutankhamun and Horemheb. They have got excellent data on the stratigraphy of the valley and on some workmen's huts; new tombs have so far eluded them.</p>		<p><b>Cambridge Mission, UK</b>: see the <a href="http://www.newton.ac.uk/egypt/tt99/diary99.htm">TT99 dig diary</a>.</p>		<p><b>CNRS, France</b>: missions in the tomb of Ramesses II (Christian Leblanc) and in the Ramesseum (Monique Nelson). The latter has made a particularly important discovery. In the shaft of a Middle Kingdom tomb to the north-east of the temple, in the area of the so-called 'Chapel of the White Queen', four wonderful Middle Kingdom statues were discovered. All have had their names hacked off, but were probably set up in the shrine of one of the tombs there. The area of the chapel has turned out to be a mixture of structures by Hatshepsut and Amenhotep IV, with Third Intermediate tombs added later. A mission associated with the CNRS project lead by Angelo Cesari is excavating the temple of Amenhotep II, next to the Ramesseum.</p>		<p><b>Harwa Project, Milano, Italy</b>: Francesco Tiradritti has completed the first stage of the excavation of this large 25th dynasty tomb (no 37). He is now starting work in the courtyard of the tomb.</p>		<p><b>Egyptian-Polish Mission, Deir el-Bahari</b>: work continues on the Third Terrace of the temple. It is hoped that part of this terrace will be open for visitors from the Egyptology Conference in Cairo in March-April 2000, although it will be somewhat longer before it can be open to tourists</p>		<p>Another Polish mission, under the direction of A Niwinski, has been examining a cave in the cliff above Deir el-Bahari. Apparently there are graffiti there which indicate that there was ancient activity there (graffiti of the ubiquitous Butehamun for example), and there is speculation that there could have been another cache in the area..</p>		<p><b>Chicago House</b>: continue work on the small temple at Deir el-Bahari. They have found that the central part of the temple appears to be resting on a deep layer of plaster, in which are ceramics of the Middle Kingdom. Could it be that this is the original 'Mound of Djeme' for which the site was famed, and on which Hatshepsut claimed to have built her temple?</p>		<p><b>Franco-Egyptian Mission, Karnak</b>: I have no specific information yet on their programme, although the reconstruction of the 'Chapelle Rouge' of Hatshepsut is continuing.</p>		<p>&copy; Nigel Strudwick 1999	</body></html>
