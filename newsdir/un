Andthe Pyramids are the only remaining wonder of the world,'' hetold Reuters by telephone from UNESCO headquarters.         Zulficar is asking UNESCO director-general Federico Mayor towrite to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to draw his attentionto the violation and ask him to remove the encroachments.         ``Ways must be found to redress the situation and UNESCOwill offer its help in that,'' he added.         Zulficar said he discovered the violations on a privatevisit to Egypt earlier this month, though much of the buildinghad in fact started years ago without any protest.         The listing protects a broad strip of the desert between theGiza pyramids in the north and the less well-known pyramids ofDahshour about 17 miles to the south.         Some of the encroachments, including the unfinished highway,are inside the archeological site itself, where building isbanned, and others in a buffer zone, where there are strictlimits on the types and heights of buildings, Zulficar said.         ``The new housing goes right up to the fringe of thearcheological zone. It's a horror -- blocks of flats six storyshigh and they are cutting down the palm trees little by littleas they build,'' he said.         ``Soon it will be completely urbanized and the Pyramids willbe surrounded like the Acropolis in Athens,'' he added.From: C-reuters@clarinet.com (Reuters)Subject: Egypt to dig for tombs near controversial highwayCopyright: 1994 by Reuters, RDate: Wed, 23 Nov 94 5:10:03 PST         CAIRO (Reuter) - Egyptian archaeologists will resumeexcavations around the site of an eight-lane highway that UNESCOsays violates the international convention protecting the GizaPyramids plateau, the archaeologist in charge said Wednesday.         Zahi Hawass, director of antiquities in the pyramids area,told Reuters he was confident they would find antiquities there.In that case, the government would have to suspend building thehighway, which is part of a beltway circling Cairo.         ``We will start some time next week in the immediate area ofthe ring road (beltway) and the excavations will continue forsix months to start with,'' he said.         ``I'm sure there are tombs there from the period between the26th dynasty (seventh and sixth centuries BC) and theGreco-Roman period... I have a nose for this,'' he added. ``Ifwe find something, this road has to be stopped.''         Egypt's Supreme Antiquities Council, embarrassed by therecent publicity about encroachments on the plateau, hasallocated an initial sum of $15,000 for the excavation work,officials said.         A senior UNESCO official said last week the highway andother building work on the plateau violate agreements listingthe plateau as a world heritage site, as well as the Egyptianlaw that made it possible for the site to obtain this status.         UNESCO director-general Federico Mayor is expected to writeto Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to draw his attention to theviolations and ask him to remove them.
