From: cejo@midway.uchicago.edu (Charles E. Jones)Subject: Sahure Pyramidian ReliefsSender: ane-owner@mithra-orinst.uchicago.eduPrecedence: bulkStatus: ROMark Lehner <m-lehner@uchicago.edu> reports the following (forwarded withpermission):When I was in Egypt a few weeks ago I saw the new blocks with relief scenesthat the Antiquities workers were uncovering in the loose sand along theupper part of the Sahure causeway.  Apparently they have just turned overone that shows the dragging in and dedication of the pyramidian (pyramidcapstone).  The pyramidian itself is not shown, but the dragging in anddedication cemermony is, at least in part.  The Czech team is now makingfacsimiles. Meanwhile, at Giza, Zahi Hawass has just found the capstone ofthe small satellite pyramid located just south of the Khufu Mortuary Templeand just north of his southernmost Queen's Pyramid, GI-c.  So its been acapital season for the points of pyramids!
