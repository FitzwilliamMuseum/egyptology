He is worried that a NBC interview, slated to bereleased in the next few days, will support and publicise theirideas, which he suggests are purely for personal gain .<P>"I want to talk about things that do not make any sense, " saidthe Director of the Pyramids Plateau, whose broad gestures expressedhis increased frustration with what is commonly known as"pyramidiots" - those with views greatly at variance with theestablished scientific community. "They are saying secret excavationsconnected with Atlantis are going on around the Sphinx are not beingrevealed. This is definitely not so."<P>"I was silent for a year, but it &#91;the pressure&#93; increasedand increased," said Hawass, who was finally forced to name hisantagonists: Graham Hancock, John Anthony West and Robert Ufall,authors of, the Orion Mystery, A Message from the Sphinx, andFingerprints of God. "I was laughing at their views two years ago,"he added, but now it has apparently become a threat. Pressure groupshave circulated petitions and sent them to authorities in Egypt. andthe InterNet has been used to his adversaries' advantage.<P>One of the most popular views they are adhering to is that thereis a room in the front of the Sphinx, and that it contains metals."Years ago Anthony West somehow got permission to investigate," saidHawass; " I came upon him one day tapping all around the Sphinx and Istopped the work." Since then West has engaged Hawass and MarkLehner, who has been working with Hawass on excavations in thePyramids area for a number of years, in more or less constant debateabout the age of the Sphinx. Hawass points out that a number of yearsago Sanford University scientists drilled in the area they areclaiming contains a room and found nothing.<P>Hawass reported pressure has also come from groups who want the"door" in the Cheops pyramid opened. An enigmatic device waspin-pointed by a robot 65 meters up in one of the air vents in thepyramid by an engineer working for the German ArchaeologicalInstitute in Cairo a couple of years ago. Although its existence hasnever been confirmed, the inference is that Hawass, again, is hidingsomething. "We are not like Indiana Jones," he insisted, "we arescientists, and do everything carefully."<P>Hawass said he was forced into a two-hour long debate with thetrio on Italian Television on April 16th which ended up as a personalattack. Hawass, who is probably the greatest living expert on thepyramids, has been trying to counter the views of the "fringeelement" by giving talks on the scientific exploration of the areasurrounding the Sphinx and pyramids to European and North AmericanAudiences, but, as one member of the Press suggested, the cauldronbrewing against established authority, may be allowing the "fringies"to bubble to the top.<P>Hawass' emphasized that the main goal of the SCA is to conservethe pyramids, not exploit them, and cited recent plans to improve thepyramids environment, including moving the stables for horses andcamels, the tourist busses and a picnic area out in the desert nearthe pyramids. "It costs us LE 100,000 a year to clean up after theanimals," he added, noting that the LE 3 million entrance fees fromthe Great Pyramid (Cheops) are not enough to do the necessaryconservation work. "To restore one side of the pyramid costs about$50,000.00" he said. Blocks on the side of the second pyramid(Chephren) are deteriorating and need to be repaired, and the thirdpyramid - that of Mycerinus - was closed three days ago to manage thecracks that have developed and to remove tourists' graffiti. TheSCA's attempt to open Abu Sir as a tourist area has been stalled, butHawass contends it will be open by the end of the year. He also citedefforts to remove new houses on the Giza Plateau. "Houses are sitepollution," he asserted, mentioning the recent decision by the GizaGovernate to relocate Nazlett es Simman residents to a new 3square-mile city near the Fayum Road where tourist trades could beplied in a craft-centre environment.<P>"If I am in charge of antiquities," he stated, adding quickly "-and I hope I am not - I would stop all excavating in Upper Egypt forten years; plenty needs to be done in conservation, epigraphy andsurvey, particularly on pharaonic sites. We should concentrate onexcavations in the Delta." Hawass' own clearance work around thepyramids suggested 1920s excavators Hermann Junker and Reisner werenot very thorough; he found 65 tombs that they had missed.<P></BODY></HTML>
