Ali Hassan, director of excavations at the SupremeAntiquities Council, said Wednesday the jewelry was found in a secret nichein the wall of a passageway under the pyramid of the 12th dynasty pharaohSenusert III at Dahshour. Some of the pieces are inscribed with the name ofQueen Nefret, also known as Khanumet. She was the mother of Senusert IIIand the wife and sister of his father, Senusert II. The trove includes twoblue amethyst scarabs, gold brooches, necklaces of semi-precious stones,gold pendants inlaid with cornelian and two gold lockets shaped like lions.``They are completely priceless and of great importance both for thechronology (of the 12th dynasty) and for the history of the use ofscarabs,'' Hassan said. A scarab is a black, winged beetle whose image wasoften cut from a stone or gem, engraved with inscriptions and worn as acharm or used as a seal. Like other Egyptian pyramids, that of Senusret IIIwas robbed in antiquity but the robbers overlooked the niche. ``The factthat the jewelry was hidden there shows that even in those days they wereworried about theft,'' Hassan said. A mission from the Metropolitan Museumin New York came across the jewelry while doing a thorough exploration ofthe passages close to the queen's burial chamber under the pyramid, whichlies 20 miles south of Cairo. Hassan said the trove was in the EgyptianMuseum in Cairo for safekeeping and a decision would be made on itsdisplay. The reign of Senusert III, traditionally dated from 1878 BC to1843 BC, was one of the golden ages of ancient Egyptiancivilization.
