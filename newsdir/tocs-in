They come (so far)from 113 journals, which we have divided into 4 categories: Classics,Archaeology, Religion and Near Eastern Studies, and Miscellaneous(listed below).445 articles have been added to the archive since September 30: theseare now stored in files called new92.toc, new93.toc and new94.toc. Theinformation file, inform.toc, lists all the journals covered and theissues represented to date -- journals marked NEW have one or moreissues in one or more of the "new" files. The contents of the "new" files will shortly be distributed into theappropriate files by subject, so ftp'ers may want to collect these fileswithin the next week or so:     ftp ftp.epas.utoronto.ca         NB: note change of node name    cd pub/tocs-in    mget new*.toc                    NB: new94.toc is 62K, others lessTOCS-IN can also be reached by gopher and lynx at:   gopher.lib.virginia.edu under "Alphabetical Organization",    ccat.sas.upenn.edu under "Electronic Publications",    gopher.epas.utoronto.ca under "Centre for Computing and the Humanities"      -> "Other academic resources" -> "Classics".The gopher copy of the files is maintained at UVa, and is WAIS-indexedto allow word searches on all the tables of contents. Note to volunteers: Bob Kallet-Marx, alas, is now temporarily "e-mail     challenged" at Princeton, and cannot cajole, threaten, bully,     plead, complain, or even scrutinize, query, edit, or emend the     tocs you have been kind enough to keep  supplying us with. I hope     you will continue to send them, but to amphoras@epas.utoronto.ca,     where all that will happen is that they get posted ... Note to non-volunteers: why not? We need people to type in tables     of contents for _American Journal of Ancient History_, _Quaderni     urbinati di cultura classica_, _Studi italiani di filologia     classica_, _Annuario della Scuola archeologica di Atene_,     _Antiquaries journal_, _Archaiologika analekta ex Athenon_,     _Archaiologikon deltion_, _Archaiologike ephemeris_, _Praktika tes     en Athenais Archaiologikes Hetaireias_, and _AthMitt_.      Journals covered include:Classics:       AClass, Akroterion, AJAH, AHB, AJPh, AncW, Antichthon,     Arethusa, Arion, Athenaeum, Chiron, C&M, CB, CJ, CML, CPh, CQ, CW,     ClAnt, ClIre, EMC, Eranos, Glotta, G&R, GRBS, HSPh, Helios,     Hermathena, Hermes, Historia, JHS, JRS, Klio, Latomus, LEC, LCM,     Mnemosyne, PP, PCPhS, Ramus, REA, REG, REL, RhM, RFIC, Scholia,     SCI, SIFC, TAPhA, VDI, YClS, ZPE Archaeology:     AJA, AS, ABSA, ACSS, AK, ASAA, AAEur, Antiquity, AA,     Archaeology Archaeometry, BCH, BASO, CAJ, DArch, Expedition,     EgArch, Hesperia, IEJ, IJNA, JARCE, JAnthArch, JArchSc, JEA, JFA,     JMA, JRA, Minerva, MDAI(R), MHR, PAA, PBSR, RoA, RA, WorldArch Religion and the Near East:     BiblArch, BiblArchR, BiblR, CBQ, ChHist, HThR, JBL, JNES, JR,     JRitSt, JAOS, JThS, NTS, Orientalia, Prooftexts, SCent, Semeia Miscellaneous:     P&P, PMLA, Rhetorica, Speculum, Vergilius, VChr, Vivarium---     __                                                       __    [||]   Philippa MW Matheson  amphoras@epas.utoronto.ca   [||]    (  )   The AMPHORAS Project  43 McKenzie Ave    (416)    (  )     \/   University of Toronto  Toronto M4W 1K1   925-9931   \/
