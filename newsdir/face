It's difficult to explain and of importance toart history,'' Zivie told Reuters Tuesday at Saqqara, a majornecropolis about 16 miles south of Cairo.    Zivie said the niche, which stands about six feet tall,originally contained a painted scene of Aper-El, his son Huy andother members of his family.    This was partially defaced 20 to 30 years after his death,in the 14th century BC, and the Osiris relief was carved on top.    Ancient Egyptian artists almost invariably represented theheads of gods, humans and animals in profile, with the notableexception of Bes, the dwarf god of fun who many Egyptologiststhink may have been of non-Egyptian origin.    Zivie said the niche was exceptional in other ways too.``Osiris is completely new at Saqqara. And New Kingdom tombs arenot common here either,'' he said.    During the same season the French mission explored deeperinto another New Kingdom tomb, discovering an unusual pair ofstatues of granary chief Mery-Sekhmet and his wife.    The New Kingdom (about 1570 to 1080 BC) was the time whenancient Egypt reached the peak of its power, running an empirethat stretched at times from Sudan to northern Syria.    ``The statues are very important,'' Zivie said. ``It is thefirst time such statues of the New Kingdom, carved in the rock,have been discovered at Saqqara.''    ``The faces of the man and the woman are quite beautiful. Inspite of the fragility of the stone and of the colors ... thestatues are well-preserved,'' he added. ^REUTER@Reut12:35 05-30-95Reuter N:Copyright 1995, Reuters News Servic
