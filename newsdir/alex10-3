She spent a month in Greece where she was entirely ignored.Greek colleagues who viewed the finds have privately explained to us thather find is a Roman temple with a large cistern underneath and the inscrip-tion (there is only one, consisting of several frgs) records the dedicationof the temple by the eparch of Egypt in Trajan's name, naming Artemidorosas the architect. Unfortunately, because the Greek archaeologists considerSouvaltzi's find unpublished, they will make no public statement of whatshe actually found, and this only obscures the issue. Olga PalagiaFrom: "Richard Beal" <richard_beal@memphis-orinst.uchicago.edu>Subject: Alex again                      Alex againArchaeologist resumes hunt for Alexander the Great@    CAIRO, March 10 (Reuter) - A Greek archaeologist who saysshe has found the tomb of Alexander the Great at Siwa in Egypt'sWestern Desert left Cairo on Friday to resume excavations.    Liana Souvaltzi said in January she had found the tomb butshe then left historians in suspense by taking a one-month breakbefore starting to excavate an underground passage which maylead to the burial chamber of the Macedonian warrior-king.    A Greek team of experts who visited the site during thebreak poured cold water on Souvaltzi's claims, saying they sawnothing to prove that the ruins were Macedonian, or even thatthey were necessarily the remains of a tomb.    Egyptian experts have also questioned Souvaltzi'sinterpretation of three ancient tablets found at Siwa. She saysthey prove that Alexander's deputy Ptolemy I, ruler of Egypt,brought his body to Siwa for burial.    Maged Atallah, a member of Souvaltzi's team, said thatbefore resuming digging, she would assess the progress of workto drain the passageway, which was clogged with mud and water.    The passageway leads off from a concealed crypt at the mainentrance to the site, made up of two ruined buildings, one ofwhich is over 50 metres (160 feet) long.    ``The water has partly receded, but there may be somepreparations needed before work resumes,'' Atallah told Reuters.    He was speaking at a meeting late on Thursday of Greek andEgyptian historians to discuss the Siwa discovery.    Most historians, citing ancient Greek and Roman writers,believe Alexander, who died in Babylon in 323 BC, was buried inthe Mediterranean port city he founded -- Alexandria. But modernexcavators have failed to find signs of his tomb there.    Historian Hassan Ragab told Thursday's meeting thatSouvaltzi may have uncovered a tomb built for Alexander butnever used for that purpose.    He said that in the tumultuous years after Alexander'sdeath, his successors quarrelled for the honour of burying theman whose conquests spread Greek influence throughout theMediterranean and deep into Asia.    ``Ptolemy himself may have built two tombs for Alexander --one in Siwa and another in Alexandria,'' Ragab said. REUTERReut05:02 03-10Reuter N:Copyright 1995, Reuters News Service
