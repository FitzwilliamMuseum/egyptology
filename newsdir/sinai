There had been no indication of the existenceof a large town servicing the fortress.        ``This changes everything we thought we knew,'' said MohammedAbdel Maksoud, head of the excavation. ``In one moment we'vechanged the face of the desert. There's life again here in theSinai.''        In mid-September, excavators began unearthing the 1,700-year-oldfortress in sight of a modern highway connecting Egypt's westernSinai with Israel that generally follows the ancient road. The siteis a five-minute drive from the Suez Canal.        The discoveries are the latest in a series of surprises forarchaeologists working hard to stay ahead of bulldozers carving acanal system in the Sinai desert that is to transform thousands ofarid acres into farmland.        The Salaam Canal follows the ancient highway's path andthreatens 1,000 known antiquity sites. So far, Egyptian and foreignteams are excavating or recording 23 sites along a 20-mile stretch.        Maksoud said the discovery is the first Roman fortress found innorthern Egypt. Similar forts in the Nubian region, which straddlesthe Egypt-Sudan border, were lost in the 1960s with construction ofthe Aswan High Dam and the creation of Lake Nasser behind it.        The fort, once defended by 12 towers, is unique in Egypt becauseits mud-brick walls are colored white, Maksoud said. ``Maybe theymixed chalk with mud. We don't know, because we've never seenanything like this,'' he said.        Work at the site is frantic. The excavators worry that muchhistory will be lost if water moves in. Relics peek from theirsandy graves. Coins and pottery from Egypt and other outposts ofimperial Rome already have emerged from the bleak landscape.        In late September, diggers unearthed a worn limestone statue ofa bemused lion, his front paws crossed casually. Later came acolored erotic fragment showing a cheerful, nude male bather thatonce was part of an elaborate decoration adorning a Roman bath.        ``All you have to do is scratch the surface and somethingappears,'' said Maksoud, who raced from one excavation to the otherunder a bright late-September sun.        The mud-brick fortress, 660 feet by 412 feet, originally wassurrounded by a large town that grew up near the Pelusium branch ofthe Nile and two large lakes. Today, ruins of the town stretch foralmost half a mile in salty desert soil.        The fortress marked the entrance to the rich Nile Delta, whereAsia meets Africa. Traders, travelers, armies had used the highwaynear the Mediterranean Sea from earliest times.        Maksoud said the fortress served two purposes for thethird-century Romans.        Soldiers were stationed inside, ready for marching orders.Excavators have found more than 400 grain silos in the area, animmediate food supply if the army had to move out or came undersiege. A large cache of weapons along with horses would have beenkept inside the fort.        But for Maksoud the fort's more important function wasfinancial, as the toll station controlling the lucrative tradealong the popular highway. Traders and caravans had to stop and buya government stamp allowing them to carry on with their business.Getting the stamp could take days.        Maksoud said Roman records testify to three fortresses in thewestern Sinai. Nine others lay further inland, each about 30 milesapart.        Because of its location, the newly discovered fort would havebeen by the far the largest, grandest and most important.*********************************************************David I.
