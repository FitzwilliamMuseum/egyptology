Notre Dame is in 		South Bend, Indiana, USA,  about 90 miles from Chicago. The amount of material 		is planned to be equal to a full academic year's course -- we'll be meeting 		five days a week, three hours a day, for eight weeks. However -- I suppose 		to lower the price -- it's being billed as a three-credit, rather than as 		a six-credit, course. We'll be going through Jim Allen's new grammar, 		reading P. Westcar (and hopefully one or two other literary texts as time 		permits), and we'll come to Chicago to practice reading material in the 		Egyptian gallery. Aside from Allen's grammar, purchase of Henry G. 		Fischer's Ancient Egyptian Calligraphy will be required for the course, and 		Faulkner's Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian will be available for 		optional purchase at the Notre Dame book store. Here's the official course description: </p>		<p>CLAS 331 01 </p>		<p>Intensive Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs </p>		<p>3 credits, Vinson </p>		<p>9:10-12:30, MTWHF, 6/11-8/3 </p>		<p>This course will offer students an intensive introduction to Middle 		Egyptian, the classical language of Ancient Egypt, and the hieroglyphic 		script used to write it. The course presumes no previous knowledge of 		Middle Egyptian. We will concentrate on understanding how the script 		works, acquiring a solid understanding of the grammar, and building a core 		vocabulary that will enable students to understand literary texts and to 		translate common types of inscriptions which they may encounter on objects 		in museums or on trips to Egypt itself. After working through a 		comprehensive grammar of Middle Egyptian, we will read an Egyptian story 		about Cheops, the builder of the Great Pyramid, and practice reading 		inscriptions on objects in the Egyptian gallery at the museum of the 		Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago </p>		<p>For more information, including information on fees and on summer housing, 		contact Jim Powell, Director of Summer Sessions at the University of Notre 		Dame, at 219 631-7283; or Steve Vinson at SUNY-New Paltz, at 845-257-3037 		or by email at vinsons@newpaltz.edu.
