It gaveno details of any damage to the paintings and reliefs.    Security sources say floods killed about 80 people in thesouth after a freak thunderstorm Wednesday. The newspaper gave adeath toll of 48 from all the flooding but did not say whetherany had died Friday.    These figures do not include about 460 people killed when afuel depot exploded and spilled blazing fuel into the village ofDronka near the southern city of Assiut.    Rain has also hit the Sinai peninsula and the west coast ofthe Gulf of Suez, the newspapers said.    Al-Akhbar said 11 miners were killed or injured south ofSuez Thursday evening when part of a mine fell on them. Flashfloods have closed many of the roads in Sinai. REUTERReut15:07 11-04Reuter N:Copyright 1994, Reuters News Service
