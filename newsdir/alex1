Below are datepalms and olive trees, sunburned grass and white cinder-block hutsthat house families who till fields fed by Siwa's oasis.        A Greek archaeological team excavating here says they've foundthe answer to the riddle of what happened to the ancient world'sgreatest conqueror after he died at age 33.        Alexander's tomb is in Siwa, they say, where the famous oracleof Amun told him he was divine, where the superstitious conquerorsent gifts from his victories, and where he supposedly gave ordersthat he be buried.        ``We are sure,'' Liana Souvaltzi, head of the team, toldreporters Thursday ``We have a unique monument. There is no suchmonument in all of Egypt, not even Greece. It is royalty, it isreally Macedonian.''        Alexander died in Babylon in central Iraq in 323 B.C.Contemporary accounts say a funeral procession set out with hisbody in a magnificent funeral cart that was met in Palestine byPtolemy, his lieutenant in Egypt. Ptolemy, who succeeded Alexanderas king, was unrelated to the astronomer of the same name.        One version has it that the body was interred in Alexandria, theMediterranean port that Alexander founded. But the team that hasbeen digging in Siwa since 1989 says it was in this oasis in theWestern Desert.        ``I never in my life believed that Alexander was buried inAlexandria,'' the 47-year-old Souvaltzi said, standing near thetwo-room tomb.        ``He wanted to be buried in Siwa. Here we have the proof.''        The team has found carved oak leaves worn in the crowns ofMacedonian kings and an engraved eight-pointed star -- Alexander'sown symbol.        But Souvaltzi said the key finds are three broken limestonetablets written in Greek, which were unearthed in front of thetomb's gate at a depth of about 3 yards.        One was written by Ptolemy. A smaller tablet was commissioned bythe Roman emperor Trajan, who visited the site centuries later, andanother fragment is of unknown date and authorship.        The tablet of Ptolemy says he brought to Siwa his master's body,``which was so light.'' That suggests the corpse was mummified -- aprocess that extracts 50 percent of the body's weight.        Finding the tablets last week amazed even Souvaltzi.        ``At that moment I was shocked. I was not able to laugh or tocry. I was looking at myself as another person,'' she said.        ``I am really dizzy, still dizzy. We have written proof from thepast.''        The archaeological team began digging out a tunnel they believeleads to the burial chamber. Seeping water has forced the team totemporarily stop digging, but they expect to resume after theMuslim holy month of Ramadan, which began Wednesday.        ``Of course we'll find the body,'' Souvaltzi said. ``In whatcondition we'll find the body after so many thousands of years, Icannot say.''        Two tombs stand about 50 yards apart. The larger, more ornatechamber -- about 50 yards long and 10 yards wide -- was meant as adecoy. The other tomb -- about 20 yards long and 10 yards wide -- hadtwo rooms built of large stones about 10 yards high.        One of the tomb fragments describes Siwa as a city of 400,000.Today it is a village of 10,000 that is abuzz with word of thefind.        ``People are talking about it, but I haven't been there,'' saidIdrif Abdel-Rahim, a farmer. ``It's a great thing -- history, morethan 2,000 years of history.''        Another man, standing near him at a garage in the town square,smiled and said, ``Everyone wants to come see Alexander.''        Alexander led his armies out of Greece in 334 B.C., winningbattle after battle to create a realm that stretched across AsiaMinor. When he died, he had spread Greek culture through much ofthe known world.
