I thought I would pass on a few titbits   for everyone that may be interested. <P>1) Kent Weeks' Theban Mapping Project is going full steam ahead (with the able   support of Ted Brock) and they are planning to have it available in time to   sell at the ICE conference in Cairo in March. The initial version will be a   CD ROM. What Ted showed me so far is quite impressive. <P>2) While in Akhmim, the chief inspector allowed me and Dr. Adel Farid into   the magazine where we got to look at a new trilingual stela found near Gebel   Sheikh Haridi earlier this spring. It seems Christopher Kirby was working at   a temple site and after he finished his field season, the Inspectorate continued   work and found the 1.5 meter high limestone stela on the floor of the small   temple. The inscription says it is supposed to be a trilingual inscription,   but only the hieroglyphic and demotic versions were carved. The lunette has   a winged Behdet and the king making an offering to a group of deities. The text   dates to year 5, 2nd month of inundation of Ptolemy, son of Ptolemy and Arsinoe   (=Ptolemy III). Unfortunately we were not allowed to copy the text or to take   photographs. The stela is scheduled to be published by Yehya el Masri. <P>3) I had the chance to visit Bahariya Oasis and try and see the "Valley of   the Mummies" of recent fame. The site is off limits to everyone, though the   chief inspector did let us see the 5 mummies that they have removed to a room   in the back part of the Antiquities Office in town. The mummies are not bad   for Roman period mummies, but maybe not worth the hoopla. For permission to   see any of these items you need to contact Zahi Hawass prior to going out to   Bahariya. To see from a distance the "Valley of the Mummies" the best way is   to go out to the temple of Alexander the Great (ruins thereof), look about 1   1/2 kilometres to the west and you will see a hut on a hill and that is where   the Roman cemetery is located. What I found much more interesting was the 4   foot statue of Bes which the local antiquities people found in a small temple   dedicated to Bes located in town. <P>While in Cairo Zahi Hawass did give a public lecture at the ARCE offices. It   was quite impressive. He informed all that they will be digging again soon and   he wants to expand the excavations to include some sort of regional survey.   He slides of the mummies were (naturally) quite good. <P>4) When I arrived in Cairo at the beginning of October there was a report in   Cairo Today that the cemetery of Ain Umm Debadib in Kharga oasis had been attacked   by tomb robbers. Since I was planning to visit that site, I was most concerned.   The site is located about 30 kilometres north of Kharga City just below the   northern escarpment of Kharga Oasis. Indeed, tomb robbers had plundered the   entire cemetery located up on the cliffs east of the town and fort. Mummy wrappings   and many pieces of mummies are scattered all over the hill side. Every single   tomb in the cliffs (about 20-30) was cleaned out. <P>5) While visiting with the French team excavating at Douch and Manawir in the   southern end of Kharga Oasis, I had a great conversation with Peter Dils. He   informed me that the stone temple at Tarakwa (about 15 km, north of Kharga City)   had been plundered. I had visited the site in 1995 and discovered that the temple   and gateway were intact and buried to the roof line with only the very top most   roof blocks intact. Recently robbers took a back hoe to the site and removed   all of the inscribed blocks simply by shovelling them out and dumping the uninscribed   items in a pile nearby. Dils mentioned that Fakhry had described the temple   in an article, but I d not have that reference. If anyone can pass on to me   this reference by Fakhry, I would appreciate it. <P>6) Because of my long term research on Hibis Temple in Kharga Oasis, I was   most interested in a news item posted earlier this year about the removal of   Hibis temple to a new site. While in Kharga I had the chance to meet and discuss   the project with Ahmed Nasif who is the engineer from Osman Ahmed Osman ("The   Arab Contractors") who is in charge of the project. The project is a 30 month   effort and is prices at 25 million Egyptian pounds. <P>Mr. Nasif is an engineer and spent 15 years in Turkey doing general contracting   and engineering projects. He has never worked with antiquities before. His assistant   is an architect who does have some work with the recent project at the Hanging   Church in Old Cairo. He was quite pleased to meet someone who had worked at   the temple and I was able to fill him in on what little I knew of the site and   excavations, etc. His plan is to spend a maximum of six months doing hydrological   survey and making complete architectural drawings of the temple as well as photogrammetric   studies. In addition they had done a hydrologic study of the soils in the area. <P>Mr. Nasif is of the opinion that the temple should not be moved, but torn down,   and re-erected on the same site after a new, better foundation (read a concrete   slab) is readied. I personally am in favour of this suggestion, since the alternate   site chosen for moving the temple is not large enough to fit the temple and   the associated pylons and gates. Unless one wanted to put the gate and pylons   out in the middle of the highway leading to Asyut. In addition, the surface   bedrock is highly unstable.. <P>The last point to pass on regards the area allotted to the contractors to store   the blocks once they have been taken out of the temple. The area is about 30   meters by 60 meters. Once they have the first couple hundred blocks out, they   are going to be out of room. Since everything in the immediate vicinity is private   land, this may be a slight problem. They said they were working on it. <P>That's my report on Hibis temple. I can only say that I am glad I took a lot   of pictures over the years. Regardless of the outcome, I don't think Hibis temple   will ever be the same. <P>&copy; Eugene Cruz-Uribe 1999</BODY></HTML>
