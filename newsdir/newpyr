    CAIRO, May 3 (Reuter) - A French archaeological team hasdiscovered the remains of a 4,000-year-old pyramid near Cairo,an Egyptian antiquity official said on Wednesday.    Zahi Hawas, director of the Giza antiquities area, said thepyramid belonged to one of the daughters or wives of pharaonicKing Pepi I, the third king of the Sixth Dynasty.    He said the expedition has been working with the EgyptianSupreme Council of Antiquities for the past six years in thearea of Saqqarah, 20 km (12 miles) south of Cairo.    ``They found a limestone inscribed in hieroglyphics withMari Eit Es, the name of the princess and daughter of King PepiI. Beside it, they also found the base of the pyramid,'' Hawastold Reuters.    He said the discovery was made on Tuesday.    Hawas said the French team had found three pyramids in thepast six years in Saqqarah, including those of Queen Lub Weintand Queen Inti.    There are at least 300 pharaonic pyramids in Egypt but feware intact. REUTERReut04:54 05-03
