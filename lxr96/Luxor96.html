<h1>News from Luxor, December 1996</h1>

<p>I was in Luxor from the beginning of November to the end of
December, working on TT99. As in the past, I hope readers might be
interested in some notes and news.</p>

<h3>House destruction in Qurna</h3>

<p>The most important news from the site at the moment is that there
is now in progress an active campaign to move out those natives of
Qurna who live in the area of the Private Tombs. Readers will know
that this wish has been expressed officially for a long time, and
about 50 years ago the village of Qurna Gedida was built to rehouse
these people, but the take-up was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The SCA in Luxor has been going around the necropolis selecting
houses which, if pulled down, would have the most beneficial effect
on the nearby tombs. All areas are being looked at, but Dra Abul Naga
at the north of the site is the area of highest priority. Those who
know Luxor will realise that there is probably the greatest density
of houses there, and the effect of their removal would be great.</p>

<p>Why is this happening now? There is doubtless a resurgence in
interest in getting rid of the houses, but the immediate catalyst
seems to be the establishment of a new village where the people can
be rehoused. This is the village which was initially built to rehouse
the people made homeless as a result of the rainstorms in November
1994, and is situated to the north of the Carter House, west of the
town of et-Tarif. The houses there are built with electricity and
water supplies, and are said to be quite nice, although smaller than
those they are supposed to replace.</p>

<p>The problem is going to be to persuade the people to leave. The
existence of plumbing and electricity in the new village will
hopefully attract some Qurnawi who are, so I am told, starting to
think that having a few more facilities in the house might not be a
bad idea. Some, however, are concerned that the new houses would be
smaller than those they leave behind. Others of course will not want
to leave for sentimental reasons, which is understandable. But of
course there are going to be a lot of people who are used to living
in the tourist area, and their being moved away from there might
reduce their income. And finally, there are those who are living on
top of undiscovered tombs etc, and whose chances to carry out
nefarious activities will be reduced by moving.</p>

<p>I have no idea of financial or other incentives being offered. At
the moment it does not appear that strong-arm tactics are being used
to get people to go. A number of houses have already been destroyed,
belonging to people who have left willingly. These are mainly in Dra
Abul Naga, around the areas of TT162 and 164, but there are also some
in el-Khokha, near TT181.</p>

<p>Here are three photographs of Dra Abul Naga taken from the road
which show some of the houses which have been destroyed (clicking on
the photos will enlarge them):

<p>And finally here is the only photo I have which indicates the
location of the village; taken from the top of the Abul Kassem hotel
looking north to north-west, the village is faintly visible on the
horizon, under the large arrow:</p>

<h3>Antiquities Service</h3>

<p>Changes to the personnel of the SCA, mainly on the West Bank, took
place subsequent to the appointment of Dr Aly Hassan to the
Chairmanship of the organisation in the middle of September. The
Director of Qurna is Dr Mohamed Nasr, and Mr Bakhit has been
transferred from Luxor to be the senior Chief Inspector. Sabri Abel
Aziz, the former Director, is now the assistant director to Dr Zahi
Hawwass at the Pyramids, and Mohamed el Bialey, former senior Chief
Inspector, has become Chief Inspector in the Fayum.</p>

<p>The tomb of Ramesses VI has been formally reopened to visitors, as
have the restorations at Medinet Habu. Both were undertaken by Faruq
Hosni, the Minister of Culture. To accompany the reopenings, a small
conference on site management and conservation was held at the Luxor
Conference Centre at the beginning of November.</p>

<p>Work is continuing in the restoration project in the sun-court of
Amenhotep III in Luxor temple. Soon the columns will start to be
reerected. Some of them are being provided with new bases, since the
originals have cracked when unstressed. </p>

<p>No mention was made of the rumours from mid-1996 about a royal
tomb being found outside the Valley of the Kings, so I assume that it
rose out of confusion with stories about a couple of new private
tombs which have been found by the SCA in the past few years.</p>

<h3>Storms</h3>

<p>There was another rainstorm in Luxor on Thursday 14 November.
Prior to this, there had been some overcast days, and the occasional
spot of rain was felt. I have never experienced a storm in Egypt
before, and it was indeed spectacular. We watched the lightning from
the roof of our hotel; it was fabulous to see the whole of the
<i>gebel</i> illuminated in a split second as if from an enormous
camera flash. The heaviness of the rain was astonishing when it
started, and the amount of water coming down the road besides the
Muslim cemetery from the Valley of the Kings direction was
astonishing&amp;emdash;like a small river. The rain did not last long
(two bursts of perhaps 30 and 20 minutes), but the effects were seen
for several days after, with large pools of water in the roads etc.
</p>

<p>A few minor areas of damage were reported in houses, but there was
no cascade of pent-up water from the hills as happened in 1994, and
we heard of no injuries. The tombs seems to have escaped lightly; the
engineering works put into both the Valley of the Kings and Valley of
the Queens succeeded in keeping water out of those monuments. No
problems were reported in the Private Tombs; I was able to check
inside TT139 which was badly damaged in the floods of 1994, and can
report that it suffered no further damage. Probably monuments such as
temples will suffer most in the long term as they get very wet in
storms such as this; Luxor temple looked very drab and damp the day
after the storm. The restored outer walls of the Seti I temple
suffered some damage, but nothing on the scale of 1994.</p>

<h3>Foreign Missions</h3>

<p>The usual range of missions was present. Chicago House continued
its work in the small temple at Medinet Habu, and was also
undertaking conservation work on blocks in Luxor temple. The German
Archaeological Institute continued work in the temple of Seti I and
in TT84. The Polish epigraphic mission worked on blocks from Deir el
Bahari, and also on the small ramesside temple near the valley temple
of Hatshepsut; the Polish architectural mission at Deir el-Bahari
began its work in December. The University of Rome worked in TT27
(Sheshonq) and a new mission from the University of Milan started
study and clearance in TT37 (Harwa). The French mission was working
in the Ramesseum, and has also started work in the tomb of Ramesses
II in the Valley of the Kings. Kent Weeks' mission continues to find
new chambers in tomb VK5, and the Brock missions were active in VK55
and the tomb of Merenptah. The Hungarian mission continues its daily
climb to the temple on the Thoth mountain, and the Darnells (Chicago
OI) continue their weekly examination of the desert roads in the area
around Luxor.</p>

<p>The number of foreign missions in the area sometimes results in a
shortage of inspectors!</p>

<h3>Salawa! (added Feb 97)</h3>

Stories have appeared on the ANE mailing list about a strange animal in
the Sohag/Luxor area. I can add this:<p>

The animal is called a Salawa.  There is a Salawa Information Centre in
Armant, which was visited by John and Debbie Darnell from Chicago House,
and they acquired some photos, which I saw.</p><p>

Apparently several have been killed, but at least one was caught, although
how long it would survive is debatable. It is like a dog with a heavier
than usual muzzle and longer ears. It isn't a hyaena, but comparisons have
been made with the Seth animal. Rumours are circulating that it has eaten
people etc, although these are almost certainly exaggerated. Articles
about it appeared in the local press.</p><p>

One idea was that it is an animal which usually is found further out in
the desert, but human actions in the desert, like making probes for the
suggested Aswan-Oases canal, may have caused it to come closer to the
Valley.</p><p>&nbsp;
