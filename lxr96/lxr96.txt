News from Luxor, December 1996I was in Luxor from the beginning of November to the end of December,working on TT99. As in the past, I hope readers might be interested in somenotes and news.A version of this document with photographs may be found athttp://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/egypt/lxr96/Luxor96.htmlHouse destruction in QurnaThe most important news from the site at the moment is that there is now inprogress an active campaign to move out those natives of Qurna who live inthe area of the Private Tombs. Readers will know that this wish has beenexpressed officially for a long time, and about 50 years ago the village ofQurna Gedida was built to rehouse these people, but the take-up wasunsuccessful.The SCA in Luxor has been going around the necropolis selecting houseswhich, if pulled down, would have the most beneficial effect on the nearbytombs. All areas are being looked at, but Dra Abul Naga at the north of thesite is the area of highest priority. Those who know Luxor will realise thatthere is probably the greatest density of houses there, and the effect oftheir removal would be great.Why is this happening now? There is doubtless a resurgence in interest ingetting rid of the houses, but the immediate catalyst seems to be theestablishment of a new village where the people can be rehoused. This is thevillage which was initially built to rehouse the people made homeless as aresult of the rainstorms in November 1994, and is situated to the north ofthe Carter House, west of the town of et-Tarif. The houses there are builtwith electricity and water supplies, and are said to be quite nice, althoughsmaller than those they are supposed to replace.The problem is going to be to persuade the people to leave. The existence ofplumbing and electricity in the new village will hopefully attract someQurnawi who are, so I am told, starting to think that having a few morefacilities in the house might not be a bad idea. Some, however, areconcerned that the new houses would be smaller than those they leave behind.Others of course will not want to leave for sentimental reasons, which isunderstandable. But of course there are going to be a lot of people who areused to living in the tourist area, and their being moved away from theremight reduce their income. And finally, there are those who are living ontop of undiscovered tombs etc, and whose chances to carry out nefariousactivities will be reduced by moving.I have no idea of financial or other incentives being offered. At the momentit does not appear that strong-arm tactics are being used to get people togo. A number of houses have already been destroyed, belonging to people whohave left willingly. These are mainly in Dra Abul Naga, around the areas ofTT162 and 164, but there are also some in el-Khokha, near TT181.Antiquities ServiceChanges to the personnel of the SCA, mainly on the West Bank, took placesubsequent to the appointment of Dr Aly Hassan to the Chairmanship of theorganisation in the middle of September. The Director of Qurna is Dr MohamedNasr, and Mr Bakhit has been transferred from Luxor to be the senior ChiefInspector. Sabri Abel Aziz, the former Director, is now the assistantdirector to Dr Zahi Hawwass at the Pyramids, and Mohamed el Bialey, formersenior Chief Inspector, has become Chief Inspector in the Fayum.The tomb of Ramesses VI has been formally reopened to visitors, as have therestorations at Medinet Habu. Both were undertaken by Faruq Hosni, theMinister of Culture. To accompany the reopenings, a small conference on sitemanagement and conservation was held at the Luxor Conference Centre at thebeginning of November.Work is continuing in the restoration project in the sun-court of AmenhotepIII in Luxor temple. Soon the columns will start to be reerected. Some ofthem are being provided with new bases, since the originals have crackedwhen unstressed.No mention was made of the rumours from mid-1996 about a royal tomb beingfound outside the Valley of the Kings, so I assume that it rose out ofconfusion with stories about a couple of new private tombs which have beenfound by the SCA in the past few years.StormsThere was another rainstorm in Luxor on Thursday 14 November. Prior to this,there had been some overcast days, and the occasional spot of rain was felt.I have never experienced a storm in Egypt before, and it was indeedspectacular. We watched the lightning from the roof of our hotel; it wasfabulous to see the whole of the gebel illuminated in a split second as iffrom an enormous camera flash. The heaviness of the rain was astonishingwhen it started, and the amount of water coming down the road besides theMuslim cemetery from the Valley of the Kings direction wasastonishing&emdash;like a small river. The rain did not last long (twobursts of perhaps 30 and 20 minutes), but the effects were seen for severaldays after, with large pools of water in the roads etc.A few minor areas of damage were reported in houses, but there was nocascade of pent-up water from the hills as happened in 1994, and we heard ofno injuries. The tombs seems to have escaped lightly; the engineering worksput into both the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens succeeded inkeeping water out of those monuments. No problems were reported in thePrivate Tombs; I was able to check inside TT139 which was badly damaged inthe floods of 1994, and can report that it suffered no further damage.Probably monuments such as temples will suffer most in the long term as theyget very wet in storms such as this; Luxor temple looked very drab and dampthe day after the storm. The restored outer walls of the Seti I templesuffered some damage, but nothing on the scale of 1994.Foreign MissionsThe usual range of missions was present. Chicago House continued its work inthe small temple at Medinet Habu, and was also undertaking conservation workon blocks in Luxor temple. The German Archaeological Institute continuedwork in the temple of Seti I and in TT84. The Polish epigraphic missionworked on blocks from Deir el Bahari, and also on the small ramesside templenear the valley temple of Hatshepsut; the Polish architectural mission atDeir el-Bahari began its work in December. The University of Rome worked inTT27 (Sheshonq) and a new mission from the University of Milan started studyand clearance in TT37 (Harwa). The French mission was working in theRamesseum, and has also started work in the tomb of Ramesses II in theValley of the Kings. Kent Weeks' mission continues to find new chambers intomb VK5, and the Brock missions were active in VK55 and the tomb ofMerenptah. The Hungarian mission continues its daily climb to the temple onthe Thoth mountain, and the Darnells (Chicago OI) continue their weeklyexamination of the desert roads in the area around Luxor.The number of foreign missions in the area sometimes results in a shortageof inspectors!                                                             Nigel Strudwick                                                               20 January 97
