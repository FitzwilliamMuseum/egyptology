		<h3><img height="39" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" /> 26 September 2002: Mordechai Gilula</h3>
		<p>Just before I went to Egypt I heard of the death of Mordechai Gilula, on 10 August 2002. He was a prominent scholar of the Egyptian language and taught at the University of Tel Aviv. He was one of the group of Israeli scholars who followed on from the work of Polotsky; I remember him from his stay in Oxford when I was a student, when he was one of those who started to try and drag us students away from the gospel of Gardiner-type grammar which we had so assiduously learned for our preliminary exams. I had not heard of him for a number of years, which I gather was due to his health problems. It is intended that an obituary be published later in the journal <i>Lingua Aegyptia</i>.</p>

		in Jordan by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities. The provenance was inside a mosque in the village of at-Turra, northwest of Ramtha. The new stela, made of basalt, preserves 8 fragmentary lines of badly preserved<br />
		text, mentioning names and titles of Ramesses II, the gods Geb and Nepri, and passages concerning rebels and possibly Egyptian building activity, but unfortunately no regnal year.

		<h3><img height="43" width="35" src="../cyberscribe/scrmag.gif" />24 April 2002: Sudanese mummy</h3>
		<p>Antiquity smugglers found Sudan's first fully-preserved mummy, which belongs to a royal family member of the Kushite royal family, it is claimed. But they did not profit from their discovery. This week they were arrested after trying to sell the mummy to a police officer posing as an antiquity dealer, the commercial branch of the police said in a statement. &quot;This is the most important archaeological discovery of its kind in the royal cemetery of Napata,&quot; the secretary of the Sudanese Museum, Siddeek Mohammed Gism al-Seed, said Wednesday. The mummy is believed to be the body of a member of the family of King Taharqa. The mummy has been flown to Khartoum and is now in the museum, where experts are examining it to determine its identity, al-Seed said. The police statement said they had been watching the two smugglers since they first appeared in Khartoum in February seeking a buyer for the mummy. The smugglers had recovered the mummy in its grave and were showing photographs to interested parties. They were arrested after the police officer who posed as a buyer had agreed to buy the mummy for 1.5 billion Sudanese pounds ($586,000 US), the statement said. <a href="../cyberscribe/cyberscribe.html">[Cyberscribe]</a>.</p>
