July 98: M. F. Laming Macadam</h3>

<p>From Jaromir Malek:</p>

<p>The death of Dr M. F. Laming Macadam in December 1997 was noticed
by few Egyptologists, although he was the author of the fundamental
publication on the Temples of Kawa. The International Association of
Egyptologists is looking for a former friend or colleague of Dr
Macadam who would be willing to write a brief obituary or
appreciation (even partial, covering just one aspect or period of
Macadam's life) for the web pages of the IAE (<a href="http://www.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/IAEPage.html">http://www.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/IAEPage.html</a>).</p>

98: Japanese discovery at Dahshur, updated 12 July</h3>

<p>Summary of article by Nevine El-Aref on p.15 of the 11-17 June
issue of Al-Ahram Weekly. Sent to my by Lyla Pinch Brock. <b>See
correction added below</b>:</p>

<p>The tomb was for Ptahemwia, a high priest of the goddess Neit and
dates to the late 18th Dynasty, based on the presence of seals of
Tutankhamun found among objects and debris of the 13 meter deep tomb
shaft leading to 4 plundered rooms. There were also seals of Ramesses
II among the debris so I don't know how useful any of this is for
dating. Limestone relief fragments were found said to be of Amarna
style showing a funeral procession with priests in front of a pylon -
I think they mean the usual funeral rites in front of the tomb chapel
namely the Opening the Mouth and offering ritual with a procession of
the funeral party bringing the objects to the tomb, a typical New
Kingdom scene from both Thebes and Saqqara. A limestone stela with
cavetto cornice shows two scenes one of offering to Osiris and the
other offering to the parents of Ptahemwia his wife Nait and his sons
( this description is a little confusing). Faience rings were
inscribed with the name of Ankhesenamen. Canopic jar lids of
alabaster, shawabti fragments and blue-painted pottery were also
discovered. The mission is restoring the tomb and continuing its
investigations.</p>

<p><b>Correction from Nozumu Kawai:</b></p>

<p>1) The tomb was not for Ptahemwia, but probably for Ip3y, Royal
scribe on the basis of several mudbrick stamp sealings bearing his
name in the superstructure of the tomb chapel.</p>

<p>2) Ptahemwia, a high priest of Neith is the name of a person
written in a stela from the site.</p>

<p>The news still is not clear on whether the two tombs at Luxor
projected for opening last winter are open or not. They certainly
were not in early May. <b>UPDATE 17 JUNE</b>: Richard Wilkinson

98, Professor Torgny S&auml;ve-S&ouml;derbergh</h3>

<p>Professor Torgny Save-Soderbergh passed away quietly during the
night of May 21, 1998. He was 83 years old. Retiring in 1980, Torgny
remained an active part of the life of the Department of Egyptology
at Uppsala University and continued to both influence and take
interest in those students who came after his own tenure. His
scholarly production was ongoing, and a final article dealing with an
expedition to Turkey in the late 30s, will appear in the fall. In
spite of his own personal difficulties, Torgny remained a supportive
mentor and caring friend. His passing is a personal as well as a
professional loss.</p>

Saturday and Sunday 11-18 h (closed on Monday).</p>

98: More Luxor news</h3>

<p><b>All quiet in Luxor</b></p>

<p>Pressure of work has delayed this report since my return from
Luxor on 5 January. Although tourists are still very few and far
between, numbers are increasing, and there were noticeably more
people around over the Christmas and New Year period.</p>

<p>The <i>El Ahram Weekly</i> recently ran a story on the lines of
the British being the first to have discovered Egypt as a tourist
destination and being the last to leave. Although there were a few
&quot;Brits&quot; in town, numbers were very low. The predominant nationality
was the Italians, with plenty of other continental Europeans too.
There seemed also to be a lot of Americans about, and proportionally
far more than there were during the so-called Gulf War Crisis.
However, we saw no Japanese at all, and the Japanese mission, who
arrived at the end of December to continue their work in the tomb of
Amenhotep III, had had a great deal of difficulty in being allowed to
come to Egypt at all.</p>

<p>Many of the 4- and 5-star hotels here are virtually empty. <i>The
Jolie Ville (M&ouml;venpick)</i> is doing quite well, however, with a
large number of Egyptians staying there, as well as the majority of
the foreigners in town. (It has a rather charming machine-gun
emplacement at the top of the road, which is meant to be reassuring,
I'm sure.) The backpacking hotels are also doing very well. The
Government has been doing a great deal to try to promote tourism
amongst the Egyptian population, including moving some public
holidays, to encourage people to have a break in Luxor, and this
seems to have worked very well.</p>

<p><b>Increased security</b></p>

<p>On the hills, overlooking the West Bank sites, soldiers have been
posted to keep guard on the desert approaches. Similarly, there are
checkpoints at the bottom of the roads leading up to the Valley Kings
and the Valley of Queens, which are quite unobtrusive during daylight
hours, but strictly monitored at night.</p>

<p>Foreign missions are able to work pretty much unimpeded, including
John and Debora Darnell, whose work on the desert road takes them
well off the beaten track and out into &quot;bandit country&quot;.</p>

<p>All in all, if you want to see Luxor, now is the time to do it.
You can visit the sites with very little disturbance from tour
groups, and the security which is in place at the moment is probably
as good as it will ever be, without being too obtrusive.</p>

Nov 97: Luxor update</h3>

<p><b>Valley of the Kings additional target</b></p>

<p>Missions working in the Luxor area are all now working as normal.
The DAI/UCLA mission, working close to the road in Dra' Abu el-Naga',
has today resumed work after a break of three days. They had been the
mission closest to events on Monday, in that the hijacked bus drove
past them, from Deir el Bahari, seemingly heading for the Valley of
the Kings. It is surmised that the gunmen were intending to attack
tourists there too. However, they were fired on close to the road
junction by the Carter House, and so turned back south and went down
towards the Valley of the Queens, passing by the DAI/UCLA site
again.</p>

<p><b>Demonstrations by locals</b></p>

<p>Nigel reports that there have been groups of locals gathering each
day at Deir el Bahari to express their outrage at the actions of the
terrorists there, and today this has taken a much more organised
form, with groups carrying placards which read &quot;No To Terrorism&quot;
gathering at the sites. Similar demonstrations by local people were
also held in Luxor itself, where banners have been strung across the
roads. Feelings are running extremely high.</p>

Nov 97: News from Luxor</h3>

<p>I am sure you have all heard by now about events in Luxor on 17
November. I have just returned from Luxor, where Nigel and I have
just started this season's work on TT99, and thought you would like a
first hand account of what has been happening.</p>

<p>First let me say all Egyptologists in the area are fine; no-one
was involved in the shootings. At present, all missions are
continuing to work as normal and are intending to continue working
for the rest of the season, unless told they have to leave.</p>
