  <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
    <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has returned a number of objects in its collection to Egypt which turn out to have originally come from Tutankhamun's tomb.</p>
    <p>There is an article in the NY Times:</p>

      <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
        <p>Reports are coming in of the discovery in July of a rock inscription of Ramesses III about 400 km north of Medina in Saudi Arabia. There is an image in this report:</p>

        <p>If true, it would apparently be the first Egyptian inscription seen in that land. <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Tayma,+Tabuk,+Saudi+Arabia&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=24.704571,26.982422&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Tayma,+Tabuk+Saudi+Arabia&amp;ll=26.568877,35.837402&amp;spn=18.529965,13.491211&amp;z=6">This link</a> to a map will give readers a rough idea of where it is--inland, more or less directly opposite the Quseir area.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the silence for a while...</p>
        <p>It has been clear for some time that the future of the Centre for Computer-Aided Egyptological Research was in doubt. Now the decision has been made to end it in its present form.</p>
        <p>The CCER has been responsible for overseeing many of the important developments in the use of IT within Egyptology over the last 20 years.</p>

      <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
        <p>Sorry for the silence for a while... This week a couple of interesting technology stories caught my eye.</p>
        <h3>Radiocarbon dating update</h3>
        <p>A method is being developed which claims to allow non-destructive sampling of objects.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/acs-nmc031210.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/acs-nmc031210.php</a></p>
        <p>I note it still requires the oxidation of the surface, which is arguably destructive in that it causes a change to the object, but I take the overall point.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Polynomial texture mapping for objects</h3>
        <p>An article in <i>The Economist</i> describes a method of photographing objects and lighting them in ways which enhance them.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/15767271?story_id=15767271">http://www.economist.com/node/15767271?story_id=15767271</a></p>

      <div class="AccordionPanelTab">4 January 2010---T.G.H. James</div>
      <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
        <p>I regret beginning the year with another passing, but news came to me that T.G.H. James, Harry James to most people, died shortly before Christmas.</p>
        <p>Harry James had been at the British Museum from about 1951 until his retirement at the end of the 1980s, at which point he had been Keeper since 1974.</p>
        <p>He produced many publications, of material from the British Museum as well as elsewhere. I note his work with the EES Archaeological Survey, in which he was involved with the shrines of Gebel Silsila, and also the tomb of Khentyka at Saqqara. He produced the first edition of the difficult Heqanakht papyri in the Metropolitan Museum.</p>
        <p>His retirement was very productive; in that time he is perhaps best known for his biography of Howard Carter</p>
        <p>I am aware of obituaries in<em> The Times</em> and <em>The Daily Telegraph:</em></p>
