Czech archaeologists have recently discovered the tomb of a Late
Period nobleman in their work at Abusir. More details when I have the
time to paraphrase a Reuter report.

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" />Demolition of Saqqara Museum</h3>

<p>JC Paulson has drawn our attention to the demolition of the Museum at
  Saqqara, built in the 60s but never used, and sometimes referred to by
  Egyptologists as the &quot;White Elephant&quot;:</p>
<p>

UNFINISHED EGYPTIAN MUSEUM DEMOLISHED...</p><p>

...An unfinished museum -- under construction within 200 meters of the
4700-year-old, west bank, Zoser Step Pyramid -- is being demolished.
Egyptian Minister of Culture, Farouq Hosni, decided the project was an
aesthetic threat to the area. Archaeologists had also objected to the
museum on the grounds that it might hinder excavations in a
potentially rich archaeological area -- the day prior to the
announcement, a late Ptolemaic sarcophagus and clay coffin wth
skeleton visible inside had been discovered in the area. The
demolished museum was the dream of French Egyptologist, Jean-Philippe
Lauer, who worked at the Zoser Pyramid on the Saqqara Plateau for 65
years. The museum would have held artifacts from, and a model of, the
Zoser Pyramid. [paraphrased by JCPaulson from an article in the &quot;New
York Times,&quot; Sunday, March 10, 1996, Travel section, pg3]

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" />News from the pyramids</h3>

13/11/95: The following spotted in sci.archaeology:<p>

AN EGYPTIAN PYRAMID CLOSES FOR RESTORATION
paraphrased from an article in the &quot;NYTimes&quot; Travel Section
dated Sunday, November 12, 1995</p><p>

The Chephren pyramid, one of the three famous pyramids at Giza was
closed to visitors after a 3 ft. 4 in. by 8 in. section of stone
ceiling fell off in the burial chamber. It will be closed for a
minimum of six months. This is only the second time the pyramid has
been off limits to visitors since it was first opened in 1882. The
restoration work will involve the installation of sensitive devices to
measure humidity, repairing surface cracks, and modernizing the
lighting system. The work began October 10. Damage was attributed to
poor ventilation, increased tourist traffic, and the &quot;EXCAVATION OF
MORE THAN 20 TRUCKLOADS OF FINE SAND IN SEARCH OF HIDDEN CHAMBERS.&quot;</p><p>

Thanks to Judith Paulson  </p><p>

AND:

Zahi Hawass, the director of the Giza necropolis, announced over the
weekend at the conference on the Origins of the Egyptian state that
the antiquities service would be attempting to get beyond the airshaft
door in the great pyramid in May 1996. He also announced that the
great pyramid would be closed for a period of one year to work on
lowering the humidity inside and removing salts as is being done in
the Khafre pyramid. He further announced that the pyramids at Abusir
and Dashur would be made more accessible to tourists. Dashur is
currently closed because it is in a restricted military zone.</p><p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" />Nefertari to reopen</h3>

1/11/95: A Reuter news article reports that that Nefertari's tomb will
finally be reopened to the public on 4 November. A free mention on
this page awaits the first person to report to me as having been in
it. <p>

30/11/95: And that person is: Bertha Tsang; her account of it may be read <a
href="../newsdir/nefret.txt">here</a>.</p><p>

7/11/95: Gordon Govier has heard that the number of visitors to the
tomb is restricted to a very small number of people each day (the
figure of 150 has been mentioned by Alexander Biesbroek, from Dutch
radio), and that each visitor may be required to wear a mask to
control the humidity in the tomb. Gordon says that the charge is in
the range of $26/visit.</p><p>

15/11/95: Hans van den Berg reports that the entrace fee is LE 100.

One suspects that there has been a lot of dispute about the reopening,
since the original idea was that it should not be publicly accessible 
after conservation.

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" />Work restarting north of Luxor</h3>

It looks like expeditions are starting to work north of Luxor
again. Expeditions are going back to Dendera and Abydos, but the main
area to be avoided is still the central part of Middle Egypt. Further
information would be welcome. This information is courtesy Steve
Harvey, Gene Cruz-Euribe, and Hans van den Berg.

Abzu has now been mirrored in Cambridge. Transatlantic connection
speeds were making access of this important resource from the UK less
than easy, and so a duplicate is now set up on this site. The home
page reflects this; it can also be accessed by clicking <a

<h3> <img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> The Lighthouse of Alexandria</h3>

Gareth Lloyd (gareth.lloyd@wcmc.org.uk) has kindly provided the
following paraphrase of an article in the Daily Telegraph, Tuesday,
September 26, 1995.<p>

A team of French archaeologist divers believe they have found the
remains of the former Wonder of the Ancient World, the lighthouse of
Alexandria. The tower, known as Pharos, was constructed under Ptolemy
I on an island of the same name adjacent to the harbour at
Alexandria. It's original height has been variously estimated to be
around the same as that of the Great Pyramid, but with a much narrower
base of 86 feet square. This gave the structure a unique &quot;skyscraper&quot;
like appearance. A fire beacon atop the lighthouse was magnified with
mirrors or a lens and was visible from a distance of up to 40 miles
away. The archaelogists have found various masonry blocks under the
sea off Alexandria which they are confident come from Pharos and they
are currently searching for the giant statue which once surmounted the
structure.

A group of Ancient Egypt enthusiasts based in the Portland, OR /Seattle, WA
area, several of whom are ARCE, EES, and OI members, are working to form an
Ancient Egypt interest group. The aim of the group would be to sponsor
lectures and discussions on Egypt. Anyone in the area, and elsewehere, who
would be interested in participating, either as a member or as a lecturer, is
invited to contact either of us here in Portland for more information.<p>

<h3> <img src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" /> Discovery in Luxor?  </h3>

Charles Jones notes that in a Reuters News Service story issued
on June 13 1995, it is reported that the Supreme Council of
Antiquities has announced the discovery of a tomb of a king of the
18th dynasty under a house in the southern province of Luxor,in the
village of Kournet Marei.  The report states that AbdelHalim
Nourredin, director of the council, believes it could belong to a king
called Tuthmosis who ruled Egypt nearly 3,500 years ago.  Among
objects found in the tomb is a mummified human skull.<p>

More information about this would be welcome!

Jacksons couldn't swing it with museum
    NEW YORK (Reuter) - How about Grand Central Station? The
United Nations? The World Trade Centre? Macy's? Times Square? Or
maybe the Bronx Zoo?
    Michael and Lisa Marie Presley Jackson hunted for a place to
talk to the press after a museum refused to let the couple use
the only genuine Egyptian temple in Manhattan.
    A spokeswoman for ABC's ``Primetime'' television programme
said several New York locations were being considered for an
exclusive interview with the couple on June 14 after the
Metropolitan Museum of Art said they could not use its Temple of
Dendur for security reasons.
