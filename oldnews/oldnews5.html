		<p>Reuter, quoting Al-Akhram, has reported the find of a necklace of golden flies thought to be a military decoration awarded by the Pharaoh Ahmose over 3,500 years ago. The necklace, with 19 pendants in the shape of flies, was discovered in excavations at Tell Basta. It was found alongside a cartouche inscribed with the name of Ahmose, the founder of the 18th dynasty, and who ruled from 1570 to 1546 BC. The head of the archeological mission, Mahmoud Omar, speculated that the owner of the necklace won it for military service against the Hyksos.</p>

		<p>Westcountry TV in the UK on 18-6-97 featured the successful conclusion of the trial of a North Devon antiques restorer for the theft of antiquities from Egypt. Johnathan Tokeley-Parry has begun his 6 year prison sentence in a British prison. A much longer sentence awaits him in Egypt. This was the result of co-operation between the police forces of the UK and Egypt.</p>

		<p>A new museum of mummification has just been opened in Luxor. It is small but well laid out and quite interesting. It also has a new refreshment room. It is not well signed but is across the road almost opposite the entrance to the Luxor temple. Its position is indicated by a new marble portion of the Corniche pavement. The entrance is down a flight of stairs to the Nile terrace level.</p>

		<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" align="bottom" />14/3/97: Terrorist attacks in Qena area</h3>
		<p>Although nothing to do with Egyptology, readers may be interested to know this. The BBC World Service carried a report this morning about an attack, blamed on Islamic fundamentalists, on the predominently Coptic village of Ezbet Daoud and later on a train, both in Qena province. Both attacks consisted of random spraying of automatic gunfire, and 12 Egyptians were killed in the village and 1 on the train. About a month ago, a church was attacked and ten people killed.</p>

		<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" align="bottom" />13/3/97: Remarkable statue from the Delta</h3>
		<p>According to various sources, a remarkable statue was discovered on March 2 during the construction of a house in the Nile Delta in the Zagazig area (85 km NE of CAiro), near the site of the Old Kingdom temple of Pepy I. It is a unique statue, showing a man with, in front of the torso, three small standing figures of children with the sidelock of youth, and probably the broken remains of another child seated on the lap. There are numerous inlays on the statue. On the side of the chair is the figure of a baboon holding a mirror. The statue is 95 cm tall and 25 cm wide.It bears no inscriptions.</p>
		<p>Dr Aly Hassan, head of the SCA, is quoted as saying that it is as beautiful as the greatest pieces in the Cairo Museum.</p>
		<p>My impression is that is it later 18th dynasty or early ramesside in date. All the reports speak of it as being a statue of a woman, but it seems also possible (from the photo) that it is male. There appear to be no breasts, and the wig type looks that of a man. We are all here reminded of a scene in Theban tomb 226 of a man with 4 children on his lap (a royal nurse or similar), although that tomb, of the time of Amenhotep III, seems earlier than this statue.</p>

		<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" align="bottom" />17/2/97: Antiquities again</h3>
		<p>The BBC World Service carried a story on 16/2/97 that the trial of the Egyptian element of an Antiquities prosecution (I believe it is related to that below) has concluded with sentences of jail and hard labour for 12 individuals. 5 were former Antiquities Inspectors and 3 were British nationals prosecuted in their absence. The thefts were mainly from Luxor and Saqqara.</p>

		<p></p>
		<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" align="bottom" />10/2/97: Antiquities</h3>
		<p>The British Daily Telegraph on 5 Feb 97 carried an article with pictures about an art dealer who is presently on trial in the UK for smuggling antiquities, including some objects from the tomb of Hetepka at Saqqara. The article describes some techniques which might have been used for disguising originals as fakes. It has been known for some time that robberies have been going on in the tomb of Hetepka, and this story is the surfacing in the press of an investigation which the Egyptian and British police forces have been following for some time, and in which a number of arrests have been made.</p>
		<p>The German press at the end of January carried stories indicating that Egypt was no longer going to press its case for the return of certain famous objects, such as the Rosetta stone and the head of Nefertiti. Dr Aly Hassan, head of the SCA, is quoted as saying that the monuments are in good hands and well looked after, and that Egypt has no space to display the objects in an equivalent or better setting. The articles also refer to the new museum in Cairo, which is still planned for the early years of next century, and to a further 20 museums which the SCA would like to build.</p>
		<p>The articles also note that Egypt has drastically increased the penalties for antiquities smuggling.</p>
