					<p>Dr Groll was a student of Polotsky and then of Cerny, and from working with the latter, produced basic studies of the Late Egyptian verbal system. The book with which she was involved which will be best known to readers was the <i>Late Egyptian Grammar. </i>An obituary will be found <a href="http://www.archaeogate.org/egittologia/article/770/1/the-biography-of-sarah-israelit-groll-recently-deceased.html">here.</a></p>

					<h3>Finds in Luxor Temple</h3>
					<p>Reports on the net indicate that restoration works in the Abul Haggag mosque, in the Ramesses II court at Luxor temple have revealed a number of decorate Pharaonic blocks. Some reports suggest that the investigation followed a fire. A selection of links I have found is at the right.</p>
					<p>The mosque in question is the holiest one in Luxor, possibly in origin a thousand years old (I am no expert on that). The holy man buried there (Abul Haggag) is of great importance to the local population, and his tomb is a place of pilgrimage. Built as it is within an ancient temple, it is inevitable that it must contain ancient blocks in its foundation, but attempts to investigate this have always had to--and must continue to--tread a fine line between interest in ancient Egypt and respect for a very important mosque in Islam today.<br>

					<p>The <i>Journal of Egyptian Archaeology</i> has appeared on JSTOR. It can be accessed via <a href="http://www.jstor.org/journals/ees.html">http://www.jstor.org/journals/ees.html</a></p>
					<p>NOTE ON JSTOR: JSTOR is a electronic journal repository. Most access to it is on an institutional basis, so normally you have to be on a subscribing institution's network to get in. However, it is possible for those without such access to take out personal subscriptions--this was one thing I looked into when the subject of putting the JEA on it was first discussed. See <a href="http://www.jstor.org/logon?S1=cce44068.11773356720&T=6">http://www.jstor.org/logon?S1=cce44068.11773353140&amp;T=6</a></p>
					<p><b>Update 24/4: </b>I have realised that subscriptions to JSTOR are more complex than I thought. A participating institution does not automatically get all of JSTOR, and so it is possible that the JEA may not be included in what your institution gets access to. This is a major drawback to the system in my opinion.<br>

					<h3>ARCE meeting 2007</h3>
					<p>I just got back from the annual meeting of ARCE in Toledo, Ohio. It was a most enjoyable meeting. The highlight for most people would have been the keynote address by Dr Zahi Hawass, on recent discoveries in Egypt. It included among others work at Saqqara, at Giza, at Heliopolis, at Taposiris Magna, and began with the removal of the statue of Ramesses II from Cairo Station. He included an account of the CT scanning of king Tut, and also reported that, having scanned the mummies in the tomb of Amenhotep II, the (in)famous female is not Nefertiti. Further royal mummies have also been CT scanned. He hinted that he will be announcing this summer on the identification of the mummy of Hatshepsut.</p>

There are of course a number of houses which have important associations with Egyptology; principal among them is the house of Yanni (Giovanni, d'Athanasi), who was an agent for many foreigners who acquired antiquities in Thebes in the 1810s to 1830s.</p>
