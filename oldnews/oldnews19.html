					<p>The dreadful news has come from Egypt of the death of Susan Weeks, wife of Kent Weeks (KV5, Theban Mapping Project, AUC). It appears she fell into the Nile from their houseboat in Luxor. See</p>

					<p>From: AUC President &lt;president@aucegypt.edu&gt;</p>
					<p>It is with great regret that we announce the death of Ms. Susan Weeks, wife of Egyptology Professor Emeritus Kent Weeks.</p>
					<p>Susan received a Bachelor of Arts in graphic arts from the University of Washington. She and Kent met while working on the Nubian Salvage Project in Upper Egypt. In addition to being one of the foremost archaeological illustrators of the past half-century, she has built a career as one of the best general field archaeologists in Egypt, having worked on sites all over the country, both with her husband and as a specialist called by other teams. </p>
					<p>Members of the AUC community who knew and worked with Susan will always remember her sly wit (which her quiet demeanor never succeeded in obscuring), her keen and penetrating intelligence, and most of all the immense care and concern that she devoted to her friends, colleagues and students. </p>
					<p>In addition to her husband, she is survived by her two children, Emily and Christopher, and one grandchild. </p>
					<p>Those wishing to send condolences may do so by email care of magdiali@aucegypt.edu, Dr. Weeks's assistant. </p>
					<p>There will be a memorial service at AUC's Oriental Hall on Tuesday, December 15th at 4:00 pm.</p>

					<h3>Jadwiga Lipinska 29.11.1932 &#150; 4.10.2009</h3>
					<p>Monika Dolinska sends on the sad news of the passing of Jadwiga Lipinska on 4 October 2009. The following is taken from her notice. There is also an additional obituary note at <a href="http://www.archeologiaegiptu.pl/inenglish/jadwiga-lipinska">http://www.archeologiaegiptu.pl/inenglish/jadwiga-lipinska</a></p>
					<p>Her name is inextricably tied to the temple of Tuthmosis III, pharaoh of the 18<sup>th</sup> Dynasty of the New Kingdom Egypt, discovered in ruins in 1961 by the Polish-Egyptian Mission at Deir el-Bahari (near Luxor, Egypt), then for many years studied and theoretically reconstructed by the mission she created in 1978 and directed till 1996, Mission of Tuthmosis III Temple. Results of this long-term work of Prof. Lipinska and her team encompass reconstruction of the architectonical layout and the arrangement of polychrome and relief decoration of the temple, reconstruction of several scenes and preparation of&nbsp; scientific publication. In this way she helped to bring back to the world the beautiful temple, extremely important for the history of Ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.</p>
					<p>She was Curator of the Ancient Art Gallery in the National Museum in Warsaw (1991-2000), and Lecturer at the Warsaw and Lodz Universities.</p>
					<p>Member of ICOM-CIPEG; Deutsche Morgenl&auml;ndische Gesellschaft; Deutsches Arch&auml;ologisches Institut (correspondent); Society for Nubian Studies; International Association of Egyptologists; Society for Study of Egyptian Antiquities in Toronto.</p>
					<p>Her bibliography will be found at the web address above.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Like most Egyptologists, I (Nigel Strudwick) remember her fondly from when she was working at Deir el-Bahari, and we will all miss her.</p>

					<h3>Louvre will return stolen objects [UPDATED]</h3>
					<p>I have been following this fast-moving story over the past couple of weeks. It transpires that the Louvre purchased some fragments of wall painting in 2000 and 2003, which appear to have been proved subsequently to have come from the tomb of Tetiky (TT15), although I cannot personally confirm this, as that tomb was believed lost but has now apparently resurfaced as a result of recent changes in Qurna.</p>
					<p>The SCA and Zahi Hawass naturally put in a claim for the restitution of these objects from France, as they were evidently taken in contravention of the 1970 UNESCO convention. France initially resisted, and certain stories tried to make this dispute an echo of the recently hotly-debated election of a new UNESCO secretary-general, in which the previous favourite, Egyptian Farouq Hosni, was beaten by the Bulgarian candidate. As a result of the apparently initial French hesitation to return the objects, the SCA withdrew all permissions for the Louvre to work in Egypt.</p>
					<p>The Louvre did not directly dispute the claim, but indicated that such restitution claims cannot be dealt with by the museum alone, but have to go to a higher committee. This has now happened, and it has been agreed to return the objects to Egypt.</p>
					<p>There are many stories on the web about this. I give just the following:</p>

As well-known art historian in Egyptology and excavator in Saqqara Munro, born in Hamburg 8 January 1930 and always very proud of his Scottish ancestry, was director of the Kestner-Museum (now: Museum August Kestner) from 1970 until 1981. From 1981 to 1995 he was professor for Egyptology at the Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin where he occupied the first professorship created in Germany for teaching Egyptian Art and Archaeology. He will be remembered for his significant publication &quot;Die sp&auml;t&auml;gyptischen Totenstelen&quot; (Gl&uuml;ckstadt 1973) and in Hanover especially for bringing the Tutankhamun exhibition to the city in 1981 which drew the highest number of visitors to any art exhibition in Hanover.

					<h3>The AEB moves to Oxford</h3>
					<p>John Baines has asked me to post the following:</p>
					<p>From 1 January 2009, the Annual Egyptological Bibliography (AEB), which has been based in Leiden since its founding in 1947 under the auspices of the International Association of Egyptologists, will move to the Griffith Institute, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford. Publication of annual printed volumes will cease. In its new location, the project will be named Online Egyptological Bibliography (OEB). Major enhancements to the database are planned, including elimination of current backlogs, incorporation of new titles on a rolling basis, and integration of the <i>Bibliographie Alt&auml;gypten</i> of Christine Beinlich-Seeber, to give seamless information about publications in Egyptology from 1822 to the present. This development has been made possible by a major grant from the John Fell Fund of the University of Oxford.</p>
					<p>Like the AEB, the OEB will be a subscription-based service. Current subscriptions will be automatically extended until a new subscription system is set in place in early 2009. For individuals this will be based on credit card payments made through the web. Institutional subscriptions will continue to be handled through invoices as they now are.</p>
					<p>The editor of OEB, as of AEB, is Willem Hovestreydt &lt;willem.hovestreydt [at] orinst.ox.ac.uk&gt;. Queries and information about items for inclusion can be sent to him by email or submitted through the web site, which remains at www.aebnet.nl for the first half of 2009.</p>

This will make getting around in Egypt more flexible for most tourists, and is an important development for tourism.</p>

					<h3>Svetlana Hodjash</h3>
					<p>Svetlana Hodjash, one of Russia's most senior Egyptologists has recently died. The following two tributes were placed on the EEF list:</p>
					<p>I am sorry to inform all members of the EEF that Dr. Prof. Svetlana Adriana Guljef Hodjash, Head of the Department of Ancient Orient of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, died on August 13 after a long illness. She is well known from her works on the jewellery, reliefs, scarabs and small statuary from the collection of the museum as well as from her work on the exposition of the museum and temporary exhibitions from 1945 till nowdays. She was also a coauthor of the preliminary catalogue of Egyptan Art in the museums of the former USSR. [Submitted by Victor V. Solkin]</p>

					<p>Dr. Svetlana Hodjash, the keeper of Egyptian collection at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Art (Moscow) passed away on August 13, 2008. Dr. Hodjash devoted her life to the Pushkin Museum and its Egyptian collection. She came to the Museum in 1944; since 1972 till her death she was the Head of the Museum's Department of Orient. Dr. Hodjash was the author of more than 100 published works, mostly catalogues of Egyptian antiquities or studies on single objects. Till her death she was very active in museum work: organizing conferences, exhibitions, improving permanent exposition and publishing the collection. In two months she would be 85. We remember her as a cheerful and open for learning person, as a sympathetic colleague, and as a professor, who gave a chance and shared her knowledge with many students.

					<h3>Egypt succeeds in halting two sales of antiquities</h3>
					<p>This happened in early May but I managed to miss it.</p>
					<p>A block about to be sold at Bonhams in London was identified as coming from the tomb of Mutirdis in Thebes, and was pulled from the sale as a result of an intervention from Zahi Hawass. Here is <a href="http://lootingmatters.blogspot.com/2008/05/bonhams-withdraws-egyptian-inscription.html">the story and picture.</a> The block appears <i>in situ </i>on Taf. 11 of Assmann's <i>Grab des Mutirdis</i>, published in 1977.</p>
