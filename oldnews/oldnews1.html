non-scholars alike. If your WWW software is correctly configured (and

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> Bad weather in Egypt </h3>

Severe storms in the past few days have created havoc in Egypt. The
main story was of course the disaster at Dronka, north of Assiut.
There was also a tourist bus washed into the Red Sea. Luxor was
affected, and there was flooding in the Valley of the Kings. It was
reported on the BBC radio on 7/11/94 that the Egyptians have announced
their concern about the effect the rainwater is having on the
monuments.<p>

<h3>Prof. Louis Vico Zabkar</h3>

19/09/94: Leonard H. Lesko wrote on the Chicago List:<p>

After a long illness Prof. Louis Vico Zabkar died on September 15, 1994.  Born
in 1914 in Dalmatia, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in
1958 and taught in the History Department of Loyola University in Chicago
before becoming Professor of Egyptology at Brandeis University where he
served until his retirement ten years ago. He will be remembered as an
outstanding teacher by his many students and as one of the few American
Egyptologists of his generation with interests in Egyptian religion,
Ptolemaic hieroglyphs, and Nubian studies.</p><p>

<h3>Holographic Storage--from Chicago ANE List 25/8/94</h3>


I'm a graduate student in Information Studies with a special
interest in mid-east archaeology. I'd like to make scholars
in this field aware (if they are not already) of the major
developments taking place now in holographic storage with
the use of crystals. Two excellent reports on this have been
mentioned in : <p>

New Scientist Vol. 143 No 1938 Aug. 13 1994 Pages 22-23</p><p>
               Science Vol. 265 Aug 5 1994 Pages 736-737</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><p>
Would holographic image storage possibly solve the problems
of artifact destruction in such countries as Iraq?</p><p>

<h3>Aida in Luxor</h3>

Verdi's Opera &quot;Aida&quot; is to be performed later this year in front of
the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari.<p>

There are 6 performances between 26 Novemebr and 1 December,
apparently marking the 125 anniversary of the Cairo Opera House.</p><p>

I quote from a shhet supplied by a tour operator (any errors are not
mine!):</p><p>

&quot;Costumed and staged by Vittorio Rossi, conducted by Enrico de Mori
and including some of the greatest opera singers in the world:</p><p>

Aida: Wilhelmina Fernandez, Pauletta de Vaughn</p><p>

Re: Goran Simic</p><p>

Radames: Guiseppe Giacomini, Bruno Sebastian</p><p>

Ramphis: Bonaldo Giaiotti</p><p>

Amneris: Susan Porter, Bruna Baglioni</p><p>

Amonasro: Alain Fondary&quot;</p><p>

This tour company is offering a package for 6 days with seats at the
opera. However, it looks from the plan as if the seats they have are,
as we say in England, &quot;up in the gods&quot;, and a long way from the stage.</p><p>

BUT if you want to pay more you can for better seats. For the best
seats it says it is an *extra* 200 pounds, going through other
categories at *extra* 170, 135, and 100.</p><p>&nbsp;
