					<p>The <a href="http://www.harwa.it">Harwa web site</a> carries a report of the passing of Dr Mohamed el-Saghir:</p>

					<p>Dr Mohamed was for many years the Chief Inspector of Upper Egypt based on the East Bank at Luxor, and is well-known to all those who have worked there over more than 30 years. For the last few years before his retirement he was promoted to (I think) head of Pharaonic Monuments, which meant he had to move to Cairo. He was a lovely man, always helpful, a real gentleman, and he will be missed.<br>

					<p>Janice Kamrin has asked me to announce the folllowing:</p>
					<p>A team from ARCE (the American Research Center in Egypt), with the support of Dr. Zahi Hawass and Dr. Wafaa el-Saddik and the assistance of the curators and a select group of volunteers, is building a new database for the Egyptian Museum Cairo. The information collected in the database will form the basis for a new collections management system, which will help to bring this pre-eminent institution into the new century. Anyone interested in joining the volunteer force may email the team at jkamrin@yahoo.com. Excellent basic Egyptology, some computer savvy (including a functional laptop), and attention to detail required; reading knowledge of French a plus.<br>

					<p>I am sorry to have to report the deaths of Roland Tefnin, Professor of Egyptology in the Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles, and of Aly el-Khouli, retired Inspector in the SCA in Cairo.</p>
					<p>Tefnin is well-known as an art historian, who has most recently been working in TT96 at Thebes. Among his specialities was the art of the early 18th dynasty. el-Khouli is known to many as an inspector who first worked with British missions in the 1960s, and rose to be Chief Inspector of Upper and Middle Egypt. He was, among other things, an expert on Egyptian stone vessels.</p>
					<p>Both will be sorely missed.</p>

					<h3>Google Earth</h3>
					<p>Google's system for displaying satellite images of the Earth has been in existence for a while, but I personally have ignored it as there wasn't a Mac version. However, David Jefferies has pointed out to me that the images of Egypt have been updated, and I note there is now a Mac version.</p>
					<p>The satellite images of Egypt are truly remarkable, and there is in fact better coverage of the Nile Valley that there are of much of the UK! [Something to do with the weather?] For example, I could zoom into Sheikh Abdel Qurna and quite clearly see the shaft in TT99 which we excavated in 1997-8. Readers are strongly urged to download the application and have a look:</p>

					<h4>UPDATE 22 June</h4>
					<p>One problem is that Google Earth is an application and not everyone may be allowed or able to install it on their computer. There is no web version of this, but II have realised of course that the satellite imagery used is mostly the same as Google Maps</p>
					<p><a href="http://maps.google.com">http://maps.google.com</a></p>

					<h3>Fatwa coming in against statues?</h3>
					<p>Reports seem to be emerging from Egypt that a senior Islamic cleric has issued a fatwa against people having statues in their homes, on grounds of Idolatry. This has been taken as meaning some misguided individuals might take against the display of statues in museums and temples.</p>

					<h3>New burials in the Valley of the Kings</h3>
					I went on holiday just as this story was breaking so I apologise for being slow on the uptake. A shaft tomb containing five burials, probably of the 18th dynasty, has been located in the valley floor by a mission from the University of Memphis, in the little-examined area near the tombs of Amenmesse, Ramesses III and Horemheb. I do not pretend yet to know the final verdict on the burial, but here is the BBC URL, which has a link to a series of photos:

					<h3>The old ways are the best?</h3>
					<p>Under the heading 'Papyrus Trumps Technology', Computer Shopper for November 2005 (p.284) reported that the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) had to find a storage medium to record details of nuclear waste from 26 research reactors which were being dismantled. Given that the waste would remain highly radioactive for thousands of years, the medium had to be one which would remain readable for this sort of time span. They rejected the magnetic tape on which some of the data had been stored for 50 years, as well as CDs and DVDs, which may deteriorate and are likely to become obsolete within 50 years. Modern paper contains lignin acid, and yellows and rots as a result.</p>
					<p>The UKAEAs solution was to photocopy over 400 documents onto nearly 12,000 sheets of so-called 'permanent paper', an acid free material with - almost the same composition as papyrus! These were then placed inside dry and airless archiving boxes, designed &quot;to recreate the atmosphere of the Sahara Desert&quot;.</p>

					<h3>Henry G. Fischer</h3>
					<p>News has reached me from New York of the passing on 11 January of Henry G. Fischer, Lila Acheson Wallace Research Curator Emeritus of Egyptian Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art. His death is a great loss.</p>
					<p>I never had the opportunity to meet Dr Fischer, but he was a major figure in American Egyptology. He spent most of his working life in the Metropolitan, and will be best known as one of the foremost and most productive scholars working on the Old Kingdom. His interests were many, ranging from provincial affairs and administration (his thesis was <i>Dendera in the Old Kingdom</i>) to the interaction between art and writing, a subject on which he wrote extensively. He published many books and articles, and had an incredible eye for detail in texts and pictures.</p>
					<p>I hope to be able to add obituary notices as I find them.</p>
