		<h3><img height="39" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrblue.gif" /> 25 September 2001: Break in service</h3>
		<p>We've gone off to Egypt again to work in TT99. Submissions will have to wait until we return I fear. However, you should be able to follow what we are doing in Egypt by looking at the <a href="http://www.newton.ac.uk/egypt/tt99/diary01/index.htm">TT99 Dig Diary</a>. </p>

<h3>		<img height="39" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" /> 14 September 2001: Seventh Earl of Carnarvon</h3>
		<p>News has come of the passing of the Seventh Earl of Carnarvon on 11 September after a heart attack. He was aged 77. Obituaries and news articles may be found on:</p>
		<p>http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,60-2001315663,00.html</p>
		<p>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/other_sports/newsid_1540000/1540061.stm</p>
		<p>The seventh earl was of course the grandson of the discoverer of the tomb of Tutankhamun. In his time as holder of the title, the cache of small objects left over after sale of the great Carnarvon collection was discovered at Highclere Castle.</p>

<h3>		<img height="39" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" /> 28 August 2001: Silly season in full swing</h3>
		<p>The 'Silly season' is a name given to the month of August in the UK--it is a time when there is not much serious news as everyone is on holiday, and thus the media are reduced to digging up all sorts of stories to fill their pages. Although not quite in this category, readers will I hope be amused by the following sent to me by Chris Elliott:</p>
		<p>According to the interactive entertainment (i.e. computer games) trade paper <i>Computer Trade Weekly</i> (10th August 2001), the software publishing firm Eidos, responsible for the Tomb Raider series of games with their implausibly pneumatic heroine Lara Croft, has had to apologise to the French Egyptologist Jean-Yves Empereur. The fourth title in the series featured a character called Jean-Yves, working in Egypt, and although Eidos denied that it was based on the Egyptologist, an apology still appeared in<br />

<h3>		<img height="38" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrblue.gif" /> 17 July 2001: Egyptology FAQ and bad links</h3>
		<p>To try and deal with the queries I and colleagues get about our subject, I have begun a FAQ on the subject. Learn more about it by clicking <a href="../faq.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>I have also been checking some of the links on the ER pages, and was appalled to note how many, particularly on the Other Egypt page, were out of date. This speaks volumes for the very valid concern of the impermanence and general 'flakiness' of the web. I would please ask users of these pages to let me know of links which do not work, to help me maintain standards.</p>

<h3>		<img height="38" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrblue.gif" /> 21 May 2001: Bahariya in the news again</h3>
		<p>An ancient tomb of Nas I, mother of Gid-Khin-Su, ruler of Al-Wahat Al-Bahariya (Bahariya Oases), was unearthed Thursday, said Zahi Hawwas, Director of Cairo and Giza Antiquities Department.</p>
		<p>Gaballa Ali Gaballa, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA), said that the rock-hewn tomb dates back to the era of the 26th Dynasty (2500 years ago). The number of tombs that belong to the family of Khin-Su hus hits seven, with only nine other tombs of the 26th Dynasty left.</p>
		<p>Hawwas said excavation works will be resumed next September.</p>

		<p>News has reached us of the death in Paris on15th May of Jean-Philippe Lauer at the age of 99. Lauer was probably the oldest Egyptologist alive, and he had a very distinguished career working with various Egyptian monuments at Saqqara. He will be always associated with the Step Pyramid of Djoser, which he began to excavate in the 1920s, and with which he continued to work until well into his 90s. Some links:</p>

		<h3><img height="39" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> 10 May 2001: Wells in the Delta</h3>
		<p>Susanna Thomas and a team from Liverpool has excavated in February/March 2001 three still functioning limestone wells each with 2 rows of cartouches of Ramesses II at the west Delta site of Tell Abqa'in (Bahriya province). Each is approximately 1.60m diameter, and between 3.4 and 3.95m deep. They have also found blocks from at least one more well, and plan on going back next year with remote sensing equipment. The site is one of the series of forts from Memphis to Zawiyet Umm el-Rakham. The wells were just inside the south east corner of substantial (nearly 5m wide) perimeter walls.</p>

		<h3><img height="39" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> 15 April 2001: Book reprints</h3>
		<p>This is not a commercial plug, but I may have found a web site which will reprint a number of out-of-print books to which it seems to have the rights. Take a look at<a href="http://www.scry.com/ayer/"> http://www.scry.com/ayer/</a>. According to an email I have received, they need just 10 back-orders to reprint most of their titles. There are things in there like some of the Metropolitan Theban tomb reports (Davies, Rekhmire/Neferhotep etc; Mace, Senebtisi; Winlock Merytamun) as well as Bothmer's ESLP and Vander's Famine. Things I'd die to have if it's really true. Presumably you order on the web site and they let you know. Very interesting.....</p>
		<p>I'd be grateful if anyone can let me know more of experiences with this company. Librarians whom I have contacted don't know of them. Nigel</p>

		<p>The Dutch Expedition to Saqqara have discovered the first tomb in their concession from the Amarna Period. This is that of Meryneith, who was a High priest of the Aten. They have also discovered a marvellous painted statue of him and his wife, very comparable to the famous one of Maya and Merit in the Leiden Museum. This is a very interesting discovery, and goes to show what can still be found in Egypt. Have a look at the following links, none of which seem to show the statue:</p>

<h3>		<img height="39" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> 3 January 2001: News from Abydos</h3>
		<p>The media are carrying stories about a discovery of animal cemeteries at Abydos. This originally goes back to some time in mid-November, when a local boy fell into a Ptolemaic/Roman tomb at the entry to the Wadi which ultimately leads to the Umm el-Qaab, the burial site of the Early Dynastic and Prehistoric kings. Explorations, now conducted by the SCA, have revealed so far a number of burials of shrews in small gilded coffins, and also a number of hawk burials. A picture of one of the shrew coffins appears on the BBC news site:</p>

<hr />
<h3>		<img height="38" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" /> 22 November 2000: William J. Murnane</h3>
		<p>From Memphis comes the dreadful news that William Murnane has died suddenly after emergency heart surgery. He was only 55, and a great Egyptologist. He had been Professor of History in the University of Memphis, as well as being an Adjunct Professor in the Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology, since (I believe) 1987. Before that he had been, among other things, Deputy Director at Chicago House. He published widely, and his work is well-known to both the scholarly and the popular world. The subjects on which he interested himself were very wide-ranging, and to mention only three, I would choose Egyptian co-regencies, the reliefs of the temple of Karnak, and historical and epigraphic matters relating to the Amarna period. His best-known popular publication is the <i>Penguin Guide to Ancient Egypt</i>, which is by far the best guide around for those interested in the monuments; in the past few years he had also published a volume of excellent and readable translations called <i>Texts of the Amarna Period.</i></p>
		<p>Bill was a great scholar and also a great colleague. On a personal note, my wife and I have known him since we began work in Thebes in the early 1980s, days of which we have many happy memories. Most recently I visited him in Memphis a couple of years ago and spent a most enjoyable but all too brief time there. He will be greatly missed.</p>

<h3>		<img height="39" width="25" src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> 22 November 2000: On a lighter note from Qurna</h3>
		<p>&quot;Your Qurna correspondent&quot; writes from Egypt:</p>
		<p>A new excavation method was inaugurated today by the French Mission in the Ramesseum. It is an improvement of the so-called &quot;Carter's horse method&quot;, used by the famous archaeologist in 1900 to find the statue of Mentuhotep II at Deir el-Bahari. More recently a &#147;donkey&#148; variant of that system was used in the discovery of the golden mummies in Bahariya Oasis.</p>
		<p>But the latest update of the method has to be attributed to the Ramesseum team who used a car. Also, although the <a href="../newsdir/citroen.jpeg">linked picture</a> does not allow us to appreciate the details, we assured that it is a Citro&euml;n. Have the French archaeologists also found a way to display the name of the sponsor on the excavations?</p>

		<p>The media have been drawing attention to a discovery by Franck Goddio's Franco-Egyptian team of an underwater long-lost ancient classical city in the area of Abukir Bay, just to the east of Alexandria. Here is <a href="http://news2.thls.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_775000/775553.stm">one BBC story</a> and another <a href="http://news2.thls.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_775000/775558.stm">BBC story</a>. <a href="http://www.franckgoddio.org">Goddio's site</a> will provide other information.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4025635,00.html">A report in the <i>Guardian</i></a> indicates that the idea is to survey the site and only bring to the surface certain objects. This seems very much to be the correct approach, as otherwise the site is unthreatened. The SCA has of course expressed the wish that priority be given to threatened sites in the Delta proper.</p>
