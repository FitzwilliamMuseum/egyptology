					<h3>Cuneiform at Qantir?</h3>
					<p>A report on an Austrian web site indicates that the Hildesheim expedition at Qantir in the Delta (site of Per-ramses) may have found a cuneiform tablet, which could be part of the diplomatic archive of Ramesses II. Readers may recall that such an idea was floated a couple of years back by the excavators, but there now appears to be some evidence for it.</p>

					<h3>Examination of the mummy said to be Ramesses I</h3>
					<p>Back in July I reported on the suggestion being made by the Carlos Museum in Atlanta that one of their mummies, originally in the Niagara Falls collection, was that of Ramesses I. Readers may recall my extreme scepticism at the time, and that I suspected a publicity stunt, compounded by the offer, apparently now accepted, of returning the mummy to Egypt.</p>
				<p>Now the scientist who examined the mummy in the 1980s has re-examined his files and the X-rays, and has come to the conclusion that there are no grounds on available evidence for making this association. The only way to obtain more evidence would be to compare DNA samples with the mummies of Sety I and Ramesses II in Cairo.</p>
