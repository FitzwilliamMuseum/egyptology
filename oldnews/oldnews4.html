<h1>News and gossip April-December 1996</h1>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" /> 18/10/96: Marek Marciniak </h3>

<p>Carol Redmount has passed on to me the sad news that Dr Marek Marciniak
  died on Friday 11 October 1996. </p>
<hr /><p></p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblue.gif" />11/10/96: News from the Demotic 
conference</h3>

<p>Janet Johnson has asked me to publicise an announcement about a register 
  of those with an interest in demotic. It may be viewed by clicking <a href="../newsdir/demo">here</a>.
  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p></p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" /> 26/9/96: I.E.S. Edwards</h3>

<p>The following was received from the Griffith Institute:</p>
<p>

It is with deep regret that we have to report the death of
Dr. I. E. S. Edwards, one of the best-known British Egyptologists,
on 24 September. An obituary may be found <a
href="http://www.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/iae/Edwards.html">here.</a></p><p>

[Note:] Dr Edwards was formerly the Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities in the
British Museum, and is probably most widely known for his book 'The
Pyramids of Egypt'.

</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p></p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblue.gif" /> Aug-Sep 96: Kom Hamada temple</h3>

Stories surfaced in the European press in August and early September about 
a temple of Ramesses II being found at Kom Hamada in the Western Delta. 
Thanks to Onno Mastenbroek and Manu Tassier for telling me. More 
information would be appreciated.

<p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p></p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> 17/9/96: New tomb at Luxor ?</h3>

Tom Heagy kindly sent me this information:<p>

In the Sept 15 Chicago Tribune quoting Reuters as the source an article
quotes a article from that appeared in the Egyptian newspaper &quot;al-Ahram&quot; 
in their Saturday edition that a new tomb of a 19th dynasty king has been
discovered &quot;near the Valley of the Kings&quot;. The tomb was apparently robbed
in antiquity but still contains a sarcophagaus with complete lid both
decorated in color. The complete mummy was also found in its linen
wrappings but was not in the sarcophagaus. Tomb also contains statues of
the king and his wife.  Other goods found but not specified. Most goods
missing. </p><p>

The tomb was apparently found 10 years ago by man who works for
antiquities service who hid it by building a house over the entrance
intending to sell contents. Not clear if he had actually sold anything.
 
&quot;The pharaoh has not yet been identified&quot;...</p><p>

A Reuter report sent to me by David Howell indicated that the king is 19th 
dynasty, and gave this further information:

Apparently the underground tomb contains a large hall with 10 columns, six
of them marble, statues of the pharaoh and his wife and a burial chamber
with the large red granite sarcophagus and the complete mummy nearby. The
sarcophagus is about six feet (1.84 m) long and three feet (.92 m) tall,
has a complete lid and is decorated with hieroglyphic writing and drawings
in color, it added. The burial chamber lay at the end of a spiral corridor
328 ft. long, leading off the pillared hall.</p><p>
 

Any further information will be appreciated. I should add a personal note 
that all the evidence points to this not being a king's tomb. All the 
royal tombs of the New Kingdom after the very beginning of the 18th 
dynasty are in the Valley of the Kings, and we have the tomb of every 
known 19th dynasty king.

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" /> 16/9/96: William A. Ward</h3>

William A. Ward, Visiting Professor in the Department of Egyptology at 
Brown University, passed away on Friday, September 13. He had been 
hospitalized after collapsing two days earlier from an abdominal 
aneurysm.<p>

I am grateful to Christina J. Riggs and Peter Manuelian for this 
information.

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" /> 16/9/96: Pyramid of Khafre open 
again</h3>

An article in the Times informs us that the pyramid of Khafre has been 
reopened following the installation of an air circulation system to reduce 
problems related to moisture. Thanks to Helena Jaeschke for the 
information.

<p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p></p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" /> 13/9/96: SCA changes?</h3>

Changes in the SCA in Cairo are apparently as a result of the theft 
described below. I am grateful to James Whitfield for telling me about an 
AP article. The news is that Ali Hassan has replaced Abdel Halim Nureddin 
as head of the SCA.

<p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p></p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> 13/9/96: Foiled theft at the Cairo 
Museum</h3>

The Suddeutscher Zeitung today had a story about an unemployed Egyptian 
man who stayed in the Cairo Museum overnight intending to steal some of 
the Tut jewellery. Mohamed Saleh was quoted as saying that he was caught 
by the guards in the morning!

<p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p></p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" /> 6/8/96: Statue of Ramesses II at Giza</h3>

CNN World News has a story about a large statue of Ramesses II found
near the pyramid of Menkaure at Giza. <a

this link!</a> Thanks to Richard Pinch.

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblue.gif" /> 6/8/96: New Egypt group in
Australia</h3>



From: COLIN SIMCOCK (csimcock@ozemail.com.au) <p>

A new Society called the Ancient Egypt Society of Western Australia
has been established in June, 1996. The Society's President is an
Egyptian archeologist - Amany Hanna. Amany will be giving lectures on
the first Wednesday of each month at the Craft Centre at Perth Central
Railway Station. Please phone on 09 4817994 for further details

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> 29/7/96: Entrance charges in Egypt</h3>

<p>A report in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> indicates the the Supreme
Council for Antiquities will be increasing charges for visiting some
sites in Egypt by up to 100%.</p>

<p>Prices generally seem to be going up for visitors; I recently
discovered that Egypt Air has virtually doubled its Cairo-Luxor fares
since 12 months ago. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p></p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblk.gif" /> 22/7/96: End of ANE list</h3>

<p>Charles Jones posted the following notice announcing the end of
the ANE list for the present:</p>

<p>It is clear, after slightly more than three years of service, that
the ANE list no longer serves the function for which it was intended.
Consequently, we have decided to close it pending a reassessment of
the means by which we might again provide a useful, interesting and
productive means of communicating ideas and information on the
ancient Near Eastern world</p>

<p>It is virtually certain at this point, that any successor to ANE
from the Oriental Institute in Chicago will be moderated in a number
of ways at both the subscription and the posting levels. It is,
however, premature to discuss any other details of the configuration
of such a successor.</p>

<p>In the meantime, any information on the status of ANE or
successors will be posted at the ANE page on the Web server at the
Oriental Institute:</p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" /> 2/7/96: Mummies in Nebraska</h3>

Picked up from the ANE list:<p>

The University of Nebraska has begun its radiographic investigation
of the three Egyptian mummies in its Egyptian Collection this summer.
On July 1st, 1996 the first mummy, of Ptolemaic date, was successfully
plain film radiographed at the University Health Center.  Both lateral
and anterior-posterior views were taken, and the plates now reside at
the University of Nebraska State Museum's Division of Anthropology
with the Egyptian Collection Research Project.  The operation was
jointly funded by the Project's Director, the Museum, and the UNL
Department of Classics.  During the rest of the month of July 1996 the
remaining two mummies will be plain-film radiographed also.</p><p>

This is a landmark occasion for the UNSM and the hard-working
students of the Egyptian Collection Research Project.  Thanks to all
who contributed advice and encouragement for the last two years,
because this is just the beginning!</p><p>
                        Sincerely,<br />

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrgrn.gif" /> 28/6/96: News from Copenhagen</h3>

From:
<a href="mailto:OMA-ERN@palais.natmus.min.dk">
Elin Rand Nielsen </a><p>

The New Carlsberg Glyptotek finished re-installing one of the
egyptian rooms yesterday. Now the mummies rest in a virtual tomb,
complete with granite floor. Very impressive.</p><p>

The first catalogue of a series was published yesterday, too:
Egypt I, showing 89 pieces up to and including Middle Kingdom. All
pieces are illustrated with beautiful, new color-photographs. An
english as well as a danish version available. The price is 180 d.Kr.
- and really worth it.</p><p>

The Glyptotek is not on-line, therefore I took the liberty to make
this announcement. The address is:<br />
Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek<br />
Dantes Plads 7<br />
DK-1556 Copenhagen V<br />
Denmark</p><p>

The curator of the egyptian department (alias the author of the
catalogue) is Mogens Jorgensen.

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrred.gif" /> 4/6/96 Theft</h3>

I belatedly include the following posted in May to the ANE list:<p>

Nicole B. Hansen said &quot;I received the following story on another list
and I thought it might be of interest to some of you.  It's a
translation of a story from the Egyptian newspaper al-Hayat.&quot;</p><p>

<h3><img src="../newsdir/pyrblue.gif" /> 14/5/96: New Egyptology interest
groups</h3>

1. Prodigy Ancient Egypt Interest Group<p>

Prodigy Online Services announces the first online Ancient Egypt
Interest Group! This group revolves around several features which
include a comprehensive Egypt web page, Archaeology Bulletin Board, an
Ancient Egypt File Library, and an Ancient Egypt Chat area. </p><p>

The web page, the &quot;Ancient Egypt Connection&quot; is the most comprehensive
Egypt and Egyptology index on the Internet today. The page
intelligently categorizes and describes each Egypt web site, which
allows individuals to easily find anything they want about Egypt on
the WWW.

The Bulletin Board allows for ongoing specialized discussion for both
the Egyptologist and lay person alike. The BB is easy to use and
allows one conduct many conversations at once in an organized fashion.
Certain sections are moderated which allows for more serious
archaeological discussion.

The Ancient Egypt File Library allows for the downloading of files
directly from the Prodigy Service. Files include Egyptian Images,
Egypt Games, Hieroglyphic Fonts, and Web Page Building tools. 

The Ancient Egypt Chat area allows group members to meet and conduct
discussions in &quot;real&quot; time. There are weekly scheduled events and
members can set up their own Egypt chat events as well.

In order to join the group, you must be a member of Prodigy.
Membership includes all the traditional Prodigy features, Internet/Web
access, as well as Personal Web Pages for members.</p><p>

Feel free to contact me for further information.</p><p>
