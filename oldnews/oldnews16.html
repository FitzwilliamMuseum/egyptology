					<p>A spot of pre-Christmas amusement.</p>
					<p>A colleague at the British Museum has drawn my attention to a song about King Tut recorded in 1923. Could this be the earliest musical reference to the discovery of the tomb? Hear it at:</p>

					<h3>Ern&ouml; Ga&aacute;l</h3>
					<p>News has reached me of the passing of Ern&ouml; Ga&aacute;l, head of the Department of Egyptology at the E&ouml;tv&ouml;s L&oacute;r&aacute;nd University, Budapest. I fear I know no more information at the moment. I understand that a volume of studies in his memory is being prepared; contact egyiptologia@ludens.elte.hu</p>
					<p>I worked close to the Hungarian excavations in Thebes for a number of years and very much enjoyed the company of Ga&aacute;l and his colleagues; I last met him in Qurna in (I think) 2001. He was an expert in Assyriology (including Urartuology) as well as Egyptology.</p>

					<h3>New Griffith Institute photos</h3>
					<p>&quot;A collection of photographs taken in Egypt in 1888 by James Parker Simpson can now be consulted on the Griffith Institute's web pages http://www.ashmolean.museum/gri/4simpson/  The photographs are the property of his great grandson, Mr Simon B. Simpson OBE and have beenidentified and catalogued by the Topographical Bibliography team. They contain several now destroyed or damaged scenes in TT 96 Sennufer (Le Tombeau des Vignes) and several interesting images taken in royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Copies of the photographs are now in the Archive of the Griffith Institute in Oxford and an article about the photographs taken in TT 96 will appear in the next issue of <i>Discussions in Egyptology</i>.&quot;</p>

					<h3>Statue at Karnak</h3>
					<p>Restoration work by the Franco-Egyptian Mission in the temple of Karnak has come across a statue of a life size statue of one of the Neferhotep kings of the 13th dynasty. It is actually probably part of a double statue. Statues of kings of this period are not common, so this is a very interesting discovery.</p>

He and I shared an office as students in Liverpool at the end of the 1970s and early 1980s. He was doing research on the Egyptian military of the New Kingdom, and although he published several articles, he never completed it. I lost contact with him after 1983, but I understand he continued to teach for the W.E.A. and for the University's Continuing Education, where his courses were always popular.
					<p>He was an extremely genial and amusing person and I am very sorry to know that he is no longer with us.</p>
