London has no fewer than five airports. Of these, the nearest to Cambridge are Stansted and Luton, although flights from there go only to short-haul destinations in Europe and the Mediterranean region; most of the airlines based there are &quot;low cost&quot; carriers. London City airport also only deals with European travel, but caters more for business travellers. The two international airports are of course Heathrow and Gatwick.</p>					<p>The following notes will help you to get to Cambridge from your selected airport. For train information see the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/">National Rail website</a> and for buses the <a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/index.cfm">National Express website.</a> </p>					<h4><a href="http://www.stanstedairport.com/">Stansted</a></h4>					<p>There are direct trains from Stansted airport to Cambridge roughly every hour, and there are other options to change trains at Bishop's Stortford. Journey time 35-55 minutes.</p>					<p>Buses run around every hour. Journey time is about an hour.</p>					<h4><a href="http://www.london-luton.co.uk/en/">Luton</a></h4>					<p>There is a bus every two hours from Luton to Cambridge. Journey time is just over an hour.</p>					<h4><a href="http://www.londoncityairport.com/">London City</a></h4>					<p>Use the Docklands Light Railway and the Tube to get to either King's Cross or Liverpool Street stations, both with direct trains to Cambridge. The service from King's Cross is much faster.</p>					<h4><a href="http://www.heathrowairport.com">Heathrow</a></h4>					<p>Train: the fastest but most expensive route is to take the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station; there is also the slower but more reasonably priced Heathrow Connect, also to Paddington. Then take the Circle line to King's Cross and get the train to Cambridge. Journey time is about two hours.</p>					<p>Tube/Train: the cheapest way into central London is on the Piccadilly tube line to King's Cross. From there get the train as before. Journey time is about two hours 30 minutes.</p>					<p>Bus: there is a direct bus roughly every hour to Cambridge from the Central Bus station at Heathrow, and from some of the terminals. Journey time is about three hours, depending on traffic.</p>					<h4><a href="http://www.gatwickairport.com/">Gatwick</a></h4>					<p>Train: 1) Gatwick Express to Victoria. Then Victoria tube to King's Cross, and train as before to Cambridge. 2) First Capital Connect to St Pancras International, then cross over to King's Cross by foot and train as before. Both take around two hours 15 minutes. 2) is usually cheaper.</p>					<p>Bus: there are direct buses about every 80 minutes. Journey time about four hours.</p>					<h3>The University has a web page with links to many useful general resources for visitors, including train and bus timetables.
