So far we have more than 30 papers and even at 10 papers a day, we are not going to fit everything into the previous schedule. Thus we are considering beginning the formal part of the conference on what was going to be the registration day, Wednesday 20 May 2009. It is thus recommended that colleagues should try and arrive on the Tuesday.</p>					<p>We are aware that this could affect travel plans, and so we wish to hear from those for whom it might cause difficulties. We're sorry that we are proposing this change, but it is due to the success of the first call for papers!</p>					<p>2. </p>					<p>For the scheduling, we need to have full titles and abstracts from those presenting papers, so could each of you please supply by 15 February:</p>					<p>--The full title of your paper<br>						--An abstract, preferably in English, of between 250 and 300 words, i.e. maximum 1 page.<br>					</p>					<p>We are requesting longer abstracts if possible to help all participants to be better prepared for the meetings.</p>					<p>The prospects for the conference are looking very exciting, and we look forward to hearing from you.</p>					<p>With very best wishes</p>					<p>Yours ever</p>					<p>Nigel Strudwick &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen Strudwick</p>				</td>			</tr>		</table>		<p></p>	</body></html>
