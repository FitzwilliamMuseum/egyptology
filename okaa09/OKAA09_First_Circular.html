This message is just going out to those who have returned registration forms far we have more than 30 papers offered for consideration, which will make for an exciting meeting, and there are still six months to go.</p>					<p>We have done some preliminary research on hotels, and you will find some information at <a href="Hotel_OKAA09.pdf">http://www.newton.ac.uk/egypt/okaa09/Hotel_OKAA09.pdf</a>, along with a guide to the prices. Booking on the internet is advised where possible, as the best prices can be obtained that way.</p>					<p>With Cambridge being a popular destination, and the meeting close to a UK public holiday, we advise not leaving booking to the last moment. We hope to be adding other hotels to the list.</p>					<p>Do not hesitate to contact us with questions if you have them.</p>					<p>With very best wishes</p>					<p>Nigel Strudwick &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen Strudwick</p>				</td>			</tr>		</table>		<p></p>	</body></html>
