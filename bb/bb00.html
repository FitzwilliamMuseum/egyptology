					<h3>14/12/00: Herakleopolis</h3>
					<p>I am searching for information regarding the site of Herakleopolis (Anc. Eg. <i>Nn-nsw</i>, modern Ihnasya el-Medina) and its local deity Herishef (Greek Herakles or Harsaphes) particularly the cult temple of Herishef and the nearby necropolis of Sedment el Gebel.

					<h3>20/11/00: References to Maat</h3>
					<p>[Editor's note: I have already drawn this contributor's attention to the works of Assmann on Maat. I believe she does not have access to a specialised library]</p>
					<p>I am currently writing an essay on Maat, the goddess of 'truth', and I am finding it very hard to find books about the Egyptian gods that cover more than one short paragraph about Maat. The majority of books I have found so far contain chapters on the main gods such as Isis, Horus etc but not Maat. Please send any suggestions to me at cathy.hemming@tesco.net</p>

The book is: <i>Nubia: corridor to Africa</i>, by William Y. Adams, Princeton University Press 1977. I know that this book is out of print and I have searched all over for it but, to no avail. If someone has any ideas of where I might be able to find a copy; please let me know. It is much appreciated. Thank you!</p>

					<h3>28/10/00: Hatshepsut question</h3>

I am hoping to either find the email address for Dr. Tyldesley or be put in contact with someone who knows something about this mummy.</p>

					<h3>8/8/00: Seeking guide</h3>
					<p>A private party of 4 to 6 individuals interested in an archaelogical tour of Egypt seek a private guide. The tour will take place from 9 to 30 January 2001. We would like someone who has a good understanding of ancient Egyptian history (-3500 to 0) and preferably can read hieroglyphs.</p>
					<p>We will pay all expenses (travel, accommodation and entrance fees) against archeological tour guiding. We imagine this may be an opportunity for our guide to get to Egypt and possibly stay over for a spell of his/her own after our trip. We would want a fairly extensive tour, so physical fitness is a requirement. We believe the ideal candidate for this is a fairly young student of Egyptology but who has already completed a certain level of studies in the field and hence has a wide enough knowledge. Preliminary experience in the country of Egypt is welcome, but not necessary: three weeks dedication to the tour is more important to us.</p>
					<p>We would like to discuss the itinerary with the candidate. English is the working language, in which we expect total fluency. Arabic and French welcome on top. CVs by e-mail to robert.cailliau@cern.ch</p>

					<h3>28/6/00: Menkaure's chief wife</h3>
					<p>In the 1999 book from the Metropolitan Museum in New York: Dorothea Arnold, <i>When the Pyramids Were Built: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom </i>(1999) on page 68, the author states that she doubts the &quot;queen&quot; embraced by Menkaure (Mycerinus) in the statue group at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is Khamerer-Nebti II. Ms. Arnold states that Khamerer-Nebti &quot;was not Menkaure's main spouse.&quot; Most other books I have checked (Edwards, <i>Pyramids of Egypt </i>; Fahry's book on pyramids; Gay Robins <i>Art of Egypt </i>; Aldred's <i>Egypt to the End of the Old Kingdom </i>and <i>the Egyptians </i>: Grimal's <i>A History of Ancient Egypt </i>) either say Khamerer-Nebti II was Menkaure's chief wife or say nothing about his queens. I assume George Reisner thought the female figure was Khamerer-Nebti because he believed she was Menkaure's &quot;Great Royal Wife.&quot; Can anyone tell me who is now thought to be Menkaure's main spouse and how is this information known?</p>

					<h3>26/6/00: Material from the Bucheum at Armant</h3>
					<p>A number of items from the excavation of 'Bucheum' at Armant were given to the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum by the Egypt Exploration Society in the early 1930s, including the articulated skeleton of a cow-mummy on a large section (3m x 2m of plaster &amp; wood, and a life-size reconstruction of the<br />
					mummy of a Buchis bull.</p>
					<p>I am presently trying to locate these items. Around 1970, the vast majority of the Wellcome collection of Egyptian antiquities were transferred to University College London (the Petrie Museum); from there, they were further distributed to the Liverpool, Birmingham and University College Swansea museums. These certainly included a number of Armant items, including stelae and clamps from the prepration of the bovid mummies, the latter of which I have traced to Swansea. However, none of these collections apparently have the two items mentioned above, and the Wellcome Trust has no records whatsover of even receiving them, let alone their disposal. The only clue is that the publication of the excavation gives the impression that they may never have been unpacked following their arrival from Egypt (which apparently occurred during 'the transfer of the institution to its new quarters')</p>
					<p>Any further information would be gratefully received</p>

					<h3>
					15/4/2000: Thrones of Tutankhamun</h3>
					<p>I have been studying one of the thrones found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The back of this throne depicts Tutankhanum and Ankhesenamun both apparently only wearing one sandal each. Pharaoh wears a sandal on his left foot and his wife wears a sandal on her right foot. I have been given explanations which vary from, 'It's because you are looking sideways and wouldn't see the strap of the sandal.' to 'If you look closely there are two marks on the foot which means that the engraved part of the sandal has broken off.' But, neither of these explain the lack of a sandal on the left foot of Ankhesenamun. In a recent travel article in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; the author stated that 'They were wearing one sandal each as a sign of their unity.' but he failed to quote the source of this information. Can anyone point me in the direction of written proof or has anyone heard of a possible explanation? Or am I being too pedantic for my own good?</p>

					<h3>6/4/2000: Tomb of Nefertari</h3>

					<h3>21/3/2000: Seeking a guide</h3>
					<p>I am an archaeologist working in Israel (co-director of the excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan, in the Jordan Valley) who will be visiting Cairo for the first time this June, a short 3 day trip as part of my honeymoon and on the way to my dig. Since I will only be in Cairo a short while and want to maximize the experience, I was hoping you could recommend a student or someone else who might be interested in acting as guide for us during a stay. We would be particularly interested in someone to take us around the Old City (perhaps also to the old Jewish Quarter), and to know about any 'special' tours that might be open only to archaeologists at the Pyramids and Memphis. Of course, we would be willing to pay our guide.</p>

					<h3>20/2/2000: Third Dynasty</h3>
					<p>I am researching information on the first two known Pharaohs of the 3rd Dynasty. They are known as Pharaoh Zanakht, or Nebka Zanakht who ruled from 2649-2630 BC. His successor Pharaoh Djoser, also known as Netjerykhet the builder of the Step Pyramid who ruled from 2630-2611.</p>
					<p>Pharaoh Nebka Zanakht is the one I am most interested in learning more of. Information regarding the time and life of the Egyptian people during this 58 year period of the early 3rd Dynasty, would be greatly appreciated. Thankyou for this opportunity.</p>

					<h3>11/2/2000: Saltpetre</h3>
					<p>I am interested in the history of nitrates. Most modern recipes for incense use saltpeter. Did ancient Egyptians also use saltpeter in their incense?</p>
					<p>Saltpeter is apparently found in some desert areas in Egypt. However, nitrates formed in soils are more likely to be calcium nitrate, which is hydroscopic and consequently probably not satisfactory to help keep incense burning. Calcium nitrate is converted into potassium nitrate by treatment with potash. It would be interesting to know if ancient Egyptians knew about this process.</p>
