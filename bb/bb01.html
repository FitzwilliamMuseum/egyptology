					<h3>11/11/2001: Book on the Aswan dam</h3>
					<p>Can anyone recommend a good book on the impacts of the Aswan High Dam on ancient monuments in Egypt and Sudan? I'm interested not only in what was lost or saved (and how), but also in how our understanding - or ability to understand - ancient Egypt's relations with Nubia has been affected.<br />
					<br />
					Thanks in advance,<br />

					<h3>19/09/2001: Pyramids, AUC and Egypt in general</h3>
					<p>I have 3 questions:<br />
					<br />
					1) Does anyone know the status of the door which was found at the end of<br />
					one of the shafts of the Queen's chamber?<br />
					<br />
					2) Is the American University in Cairo a good university for studing<br />
					Egyptology? Also, any other thoughts on the American University in<br />
					Cairo would be greatly apreciated.<br />
					<br />
					3) How safe is Cairo and Egypt in general for an American? Do you have<br />
					any safety recommendations for Americans who will be going to Egypt on<br />
					their own for about a year without a tour group.<br />
					<br />
					I would appreciate any answers to my questions. Thank you.<br />

					<h3>21/05/2001: Bronzes and Ptah priesthood</h3>

					sand-casting).</p>
					<p>Also, where can I find detailed information on the priesthood of Ptah and their temple in Memphis?<br />

					<h3>30/04/2001: Egyptian maths--co-author needed</h3>
					<p>I have a dream to write a book about Egypt maths, but not just by using well-known problems from papyri. The idea is to make a book as if it would have been a textbook in an ancient temple school in Egypt. Also I can make illustrations by using 3D-models and real photos. So, I am looking for an Egyptologist as a co-author, to create this book together, and publish it abroad.</p>
					<p>So, if you can co-operate with me in any way, your would be welcome!</p>

					<h3>02/02/2001: Leaping Arabs</h3>

					<p>Henry David Thoreau wrote &quot;that the greatest genuine leap, due to human muscles alone, on record, is that of certain wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level ground.&quot; Does anyone know from<br />
					what source (pre-1854) Thoreau may have got this notion?</p>
					<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>
