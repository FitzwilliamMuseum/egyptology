					31/12/2002: Armant</h3>
					<p>I'm searching for some depictions of the Temple of Montu and the Bucheum at Hermonthis/Armant. Sketches, photographs -- anything! I have found images of Montu's temples (or what's left of them) in Karnak, Tod and Medamud, but nothing from Armant. If anyone could provide me with the title of a book, or better still, a web address, where such pictures could be found, I would be very grateful. Also, has anything built by Montuhotep II (Nebhepetra) survived even partially, aside from his mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri?<br />
					<br />
					Thanks in advance,<br />

					<h3>25/09/2002: Ahmose and Seqenenre</h3>
					<p>I am an author seeking a couple of facts/theories:<br />
					<br />
					1) Regarding the mummies found at the Deir el-Bahri cache: Is there any known theory on how Ahmose I died?<br />
					<br />
					2) On the court of Seqenenre II: How might I find the names or a possible resource for one or two of Seqenenre's most influential, non-military advisors?<br />

					<h3>3/06/2002: Tomb 55</h3>
					<p>My name is and I am currently working on a school essay (2500 Words) about Tomb 55 in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt. I am researching theories about who the mummy in the tomb is. What I am interested in knowing is age at death, gender, and identity in general. I have 3 main theories so far :-</p>
					<p>1) Mummy is Akhenaten and aged 35- 37 years at death, as thought by Professor James Harris and Professor Fawzia Hussein in 1988. Their study was never published however.</p>
					<p>2) Mummy is Queen Tiye and very old at death, as thought by Theodore Davis upon discovery,</p>
					<p>3) Mummy is Smenkhkare, aged 20ish at death and was a male coregent for a few years before Akhenaten died. He then ruled for 2 or 3 years before also dying and being succeeded by Tutankhamun who he was father or brother to.</p>
					<p>I would love to get a hold of Theodore Davis publication from 1910 if anybody has a copy.!!<br />
					Any new ideas or theories would be great and very much appreciated!!! Thank you!!!<br />
					Please contact me if you have any information or opinions to offer!! Thank you!!</p>
