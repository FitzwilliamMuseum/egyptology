					<h3>29 July 2006: Egyptian oil lamps</h3>
					<p>I am a student of Egyptology and am currently researching Egyptian Oil Lamps.&nbsp; There are around 20 oil lamps in the Western Australian Museum collection and I am endeavouring to find out more about them and Egyptian oil lamps in general. However, to date I have been unable to find any information on lamps in collections, published&nbsp;material or anyone with any knowledge of past or current research done in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Any information on this topic would be greatly appreciated.</p>

					<h3>5 June 2006: Egypt stuff in the Philadelphia area</h3>
					<p>I work for the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corp, which is compiling resources on all things Egyptian in Philadelphia and its Pennsylvania suburbs, timed to coincide with the King Tut exhibit coming here next year. I am looking for Philly history, architecture, dining, art, culture, etc... that is directly and measurably influenced by Egypt, whether it be modern or ancient. </p>
					<p>Can anyone point me to anything (and quickly, my deadline is now!). Thank you.<br />

					<h3>25 August 2005: TT33</h3>
					<p>For 4-5 years now I have been trying to find information, photographs or whatever is available about Theban Tomb 33, that of Petamenophis (Padi-amun-(em)-apet) a Chief Lector Priest of the 25th-26th Dynasty.</p>
					<p>I do have some photos of statues found in his tomb, and have had help from the Bolton Museum, The British Museum and the Berlin Museum.</p>
					<p>I know however that there was a red granite offering table and many smaller objects in his large and grandiose tomb, which alas is now inaccessible as it is used as a store by the Antiquities Department.</p>
					<p>I should be grateful to anyone who can give me any information on this great man and his family. I know of his mother and sister, but for example nothing of his father.</p>
					<p>This information is for personal research only.</p>
					<p>Yours sincerely,<br />
