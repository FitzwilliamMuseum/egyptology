<h3>10/10/98: Requests for information--school papers</h3>

<p>I'm doing a research paper in school on ancient Egypt. I have yet
to decide on a topic but have narrowed it down to two. Egyptian
sribes or medical practice. I will chose my topic depending on the
amount of useful information. The paper must be 5 pages handwritten
or 2 1/2 pages typed. It must have a thesis that proves something
about the topic and 3 sub-topics to help support my Thesis statement.
Please help! I need any good info or books on either of these two
topics ASAP!!!! Thanks!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Taryn Birch &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:imagica@alloymail.com">imagica@alloymail.com</a></p>

<p>I am doing a research paper for my history class and I believe I'd
like my topic to be about the controversy over the real age of the
Sphinx. If anyone could tell me about some resources I could use,
whether it is books or a webpage or a magazine, I would be grateful.
I have a personal interest in Egyptian history, so even if you think
a tidbit of info you have won't help much, send it anyway. I love
learning new things. Thanks.</p>

<h3>5/9/98: Anubis and Winged Scarabs</h3>

<p>I am searching for detailed information regarding Anubis, any
correlation to constellations, and depiction's, paintings, or
photographs of him. I would also like to know if there has been a
royal necklace in the form of a winged scarab discovered, and if so
which royal owned such a piece, or is known for wearing one. Any
information is appreciated, and thankful to receive,</p>

<h3>5/9/98: William N. Groff</h3>

<p>I'm doing research on green flashes, a group of low-Sun phenomena
that were studied in the 1890s by William N. Groff, an Egyptologist
who believed that green flashes had been seen by the ancient
Egyptians and incorporated into their written language as a
pictograph representing this phenomenon (see B.I.E.(3)
6,243-262(1895) and 7,279-301(1896) for his two major papers on this
subject, preceded by a series of shorter notes.) I can assure you
that Groff's observations of green flashes are accurate (see
http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/ for more information about them). The
question is, are his archaeological inferences valid? I have asked a
couple of egyptologists about this, but nobody seems to have heard of
Groff or his green-flash work. Can you refer me to anyone who might
be able to offer an informed opinion on this matter?</p>

<p>RE: Photo Call for the book: Cleopatra's Palace<br />
A Discovery Channel Publication</p>

<p>I am working on a book with Discover Channel Communications to
produce a highly visual book on the city of Alexandria and the search
for Cleopatra's sunken Palace of the Ptolemaic Period of 332-30 BC.
This book will be published in conjunction with television
documentary and educational programming on the same subject. I am
looking for any photo materials surrounding the subject matter listed
below.</p>

<p>The books visuals will balance contemporary imagery of Cleopatra,
Caesar, Antony, Octavian, and other characters like Pompey the Great,
Cicero, Calpurnia (Caesar's last Roman wife), Fulvia (Antony's second
Roman wife), Octavia (Antony's third Roman wife), Servillia (Caesar's
long-time mistress and mother of Brutus), Lepidus, Cassius, Decimus
Brutus, and Brutus.</p>

<p>We would be looking for coins, sculpture, illustrations, maps,
carvings, and fine art of ancient Alexandria and its splendours, and
of Cleopatra herself (the subject of many fine painters, among works
we favour are those of French and English). We will cover the
beginnings of the city when Alexander the Great designed it, to the
everyday lifestyle of the very sophisticated people. We will be
showing everyday items like tools, plates, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to this subject, we are also looking for any material
for a book on Napoleon.</p>

<p>If anyone can help me out, please respond.</p>

<h3>5/7/98: Man-made stone?</h3>

<p>As an engineer (with no knowledge of Egyptology) I was fascinated
by &quot;Vth Egyptology Congress, Cairo, 1988: The Famine Stele and the
construction of Pyramids with man-made stone&quot; and some of the other
relate &quot;Famine Stele&quot; papers from the Geopolymer Institute.</p>

<p>Are there any papers available which provide an Egyptologist's
critique of these papers? I have assumed that as the theory does not
seem to have progressed that there must have been a fundamental flaw
with it.</p>

Luxor/Thebes for descriptions of the monuments as they then appeared,
i.e. Medinet Habu, the Ramesseum, Hatshepsut's temple at Deir el
Bahri, and Karnak/Luxor temples. Also, were there any English teams
working the area at that time? What rest houses, if any, were
available (such as Carter's house)? I would greatly appreciate any
information, especially from someone who had been there.</p>

<h3>27/2/98: Some general questions</h3>

<p>I'm writing a book on adventure travel called &quot;Let's Get Lost&quot;
that will be published in 18 months by Warner, and one chapter takes
place in Egypt (or more specifically Kemet and Sin), and I was
wondering if someone could help me with two issues:</p>

<p>-- Is it generally thought that the hypostyle halls with columns
topped in lotus and papyrus crowns represent a bountiful wetlands
such as those commonly depicted on the walls?</p>

<p>-- Were the ancient Egyptians a mix of black and Levantine skin
colors, or were they all one or the other, or something else
besides?</p>

<p>My attempts to answer either of these questions with other sources
have been unsuccessful so any help that could be given to this layman
would be greatly appreciated, and if the answer is 'we don't know,'
that would be just as appreciated.</p>

<h3>27/2/98: DNA question</h3>

<p>I am an amateur (VERY, VERY AMATEUR) aficionado of ancient
Egyptology. I heard Dr. Scott Woodward say on The Discovery Channel's
&quot;Secrets of the Pharaohs,&quot; &quot;From the samples that we have so far
which cover eight generations of the 18th Dynasty, we see a very
narrow gene pool.&quot; Does that mean that he has sampled King
Tutankhamen's DNA, and, if so, how close was the match to the DNA of
the two infant mummies found in his tomb and to preceding Pharaohs of
the 18th Dynasty?</p>

<p>I have been making futile searches for information in this regard
on the WWW and have been unable to find out any definitive
information or theories.</p>

<p>May I please hear from you. Thank you very much.</p>
