      <h3>22/11/99: T4 chariot</h3>
      <p>My name is Amy Meilleur, and I am a graduate student in Egyptology. Currently 
        I am researching the chariot body found in the tomb of Tuthmosis IV first 
        published by Carter and Newberry in 1908. Unfortunately, I have been unable 
        to find any recent information about this object, or any modern images 
        of it. All I have found have been reprints of the original photographs 
        and/or drawings. Does anyone know if it is on display in Cairo, and, if 
        so, what condition it is in? I would appreciate any input regarding this 
        object. Thank you.</p>

        need to be before anything Greaves published. I know Mercator explored

        he did). </p>

        between Akhenaten, Smenkhare and Tutankhamun? Recent books by Dr.Tylesley 
        and Bob Brier have Akhenaten and Tutankhamun as half brothers/father and 
        son respectively. Smenkhare is either a half brother or son of Akhenaten 
        and in the Tyldesley book ' Daughters of Isis' Smenkhare may even be Neferititi 
        in the guise of a male, in co-regency with Akhenaten.Other theories have 
        Tutankhamun as the son of Akhenaten by Kiye, a secondary wife. I would 
        be glad of any clarification on this problem.</p>

        and wig tails of Horus, 8 inches wide. The under half of the sarcophagus

        intact wood pin fasteners. The mummy effigy is in the shape of an infant, 
        split into two pieces at the thorax. The resinated linen and papyrus wrapping 
        is fully intact. Wheat grains and dried mud are clearly visible in the 
      split cross section. </p>

&quot;tchefau&quot; food that the gods and Khus lived on?</p>
      <p>d) a few of the vignettes in the book of the dead show the djed pillar, 
        supporting the Ankh sign, which in turn supports the sun. Does this demonstrate 
        a similarity with Aztec and Mayan beliefs that sacrifice in some way ensured

      <p>I am leading a team of Graduate students in Computer Arts in a short

        Egypt. As we begin pre-production, I would like to solicit informed opinions 
        as to what visualization/reconstruction efforts would be of real value 
        to persons working in the field or in research. At our disposal we have 
        the ability to perform 3D laser radar scans of actual sites, as well as 
        comprehensive capabilities in 3D computer graphic imagery. Under my direction, 
        similar student groups have successfully completed work for The Discovery 
        Channel, CNN, as well as a host of museums and organizations.</p>
      <p>Ideally, I am hoping that a collaborative relationship could be established 
        so that a student group would create visualizations of work that is currently 
        in progress; our goal is to use our design and visualization skills to 
        support interesting projects that could benefit from these elements. All 
        work created by our team would be donated to the appropriate researchers

      <h3>28/2/99: MUMMY AUTOPSIES, OBESITY, AND HEART DISEASE</h3>
      <p>I'm an information researcher and writer in nutrition and health and 
        am finishing up a review for health professionals of the Protein Power 
        diet book promoting a low-carbo/high-fat diet. The authors bolster their 
        case by claiming that autopsies of ancient Egyptian mummies reveal a surprisingly 
        high degree of heart disease and obesity and blame a plant centered diet 
        rich in whole grains, fruits, and veggies (with a little meat thrown in). 
        This runs contrary to nearly all epidemiological studies which show that 
        populations like the Tarahumaras and rural Chinese who subsist on low-fat/high-carbo/high-fiber 
        traditional diets are indeed as healthy as those on the traditional moderate-carbo/moderate-fat 
        Mediterranean diet (as long as they remain physically active). Was mummification 
        confined mainly to the upper classes who were likely to have &quot;affluent&quot; 
        diets high in animal fat and low in fiber, fruit, veggies, and whole grains? 
        Did they get less exercise than the working class? Could a high incidence

      <p>1. Budge states in his translation of the Book of Gates that souls were 
        encouraged to travel north to south to the Tuat during the period in which 
        'Osiris absorb&#91;ed&#93; the position and attributes of Khent-Amenti, 
        perhaps the oldest god of the dead of Abydos'. When and why did this happen?</p>
      <p>2. Where can I access a list of the nomes of Ancient Egypt and the gods 
        associated with them?</p>
      <p>Thank you in advance,</p>
