Part II will follow<br>			within a day.  My apologies to any author whose papers I may have<br>			misconstrued or misrepresented.<br>			<br>			************************************************************ <br>			<br>			At the annual meeting of the American Historical Association earlier<br>			this month the session was convened entitled, &quot;Black Athena.&quot;  This<br>			session, co-sponsored by the World History Assn., was well attended<br>			with standing room only that stretched out the door and into the<br>			hallway.  Most of the attendees seemed to be general historians or<br>			instructors of western civilization and world history.  There was, at<br>			least, one Africanist who made himself known.  There were probably<br>			some ancient/classical historians, although they did not identify<br>			themselves, and there were good numbers of African/African-American<br>			historians.  Other than myself, there were no Egyptologists, and there<br>			was only one Near Eastern historian I recognized (a Hittitologist).<br>			<br>			The moderator of the session, David R. Smith, acknowledged that the<br>			purpose of the session was to provide insight into a topic with which<br>			more and more world historians are having to come to terms (due to<br>			pressure from students, their departments, etc.).  Indeed, I noted<br>			that some attendees brought well-thumbed copies of BLACK ATHENA to the<br>			session.<br>			<br>			The three panelists consisted of: Stanley Burstein (Hellenistic<br>			historian specializing in, among other things, Ptolemaic Egypt), Eric<br>			Cline (Aegean authority specializing in Egypt's relations with Greece<br>			in the Bronze Age), and Pamela Gordon (classicist/historian<br>			specializing in Greek literature).  Martin Bernal (a Sinologist<br>			specializing in -?-) provided comment, while Carol Thomas (an ancient<br>			historian) rendered counter-comment.<br>			<br>			While Burstein and Cline both acknowledged that Bernal's conclusions<br>			were based upon a mammoth stack of details and arguments, many of<br>			which were outrightly wrong, they did not actually present a litany of<br>			these details and errors (which probably was for the best, given the<br>			nature of the forum and the backgrounds of the panelists and<br>			attendees).  Indeed, everyone was quite conscious to stay away from<br>			attacking details and, instead, concerned themselves with Bernal's<br>			general approach and overall interpretations.  It was all friendly and<br>			collegial.  Bernal himself was charming, witty, and very polished with<br>			his audience.  I noted that some attendees were already sympathetic or<br>			supportive of his notions.<br>			<br>			I thought the papers of Burstein and Cline very cogent and well done.<br>			Burstein, speaking on &quot;Egypt's Place in Greece,&quot; noted that in<br>			discussing Greco-Egyptian cultural relations, Bernal often ignored<br>			Greece's influence on later Egyptian intellectual thought; that the<br>			transmission of cultural influences was not in one direction only.  He<br>			also argued that in devising his historiographical models (i.e., the<br>			Ancient Model, the Aryan Model, and the Modified Ancient Model),<br>			Bernal, himself, was underestimating and ignoring the extent to which<br>			the Ancient Model was still being debated into the twentieth century.<br>			I.e., Bernal's nineteenth-century cutoff date of the Ancient<br>			Model--due to the nationalistic/racist sentiments prevalent then-- was<br>			not as absolute as Bernal contends.  Burstein also noted that Bernal<br>			failed to consider the &quot;whitening&quot; of ancient Egypt by nineteenth<br>			century American anthropologists in his Aryan Model.  In his<br>			commentary, Bernal did concede these two points to Burstein.<br>			<br>			Burstein and Cline agreed in that there were cultural and economic<br>			contacts between Egypt and Greece in the second millennium B.C.<br>			Burstein even described Egyptian elements appearing in Greek<br>			literature and thought; however, he contended, Bernal was making too<br>			much of these and misinterpreting them.  Citing Bernal's<br>			misinterpretation of the Aegean name-list of King Amenhotep III, both<br>			Burstein and Cline faulted Bernal for positing that the level of<br>			Egyptian influence on Greece could ONLY have occurred with political<br>			and military dominance (viz., Bernal's notions that Egypt actually<br>			conquered and colonized Greece in the 12th Dynasty, followed later by<br>			the Hyksos, whom he contends were Indo-aryans).  Here Burstein is<br>			absolutely correct; the notion that the Hyksos could be transmitters<br>			of Egyptian culture is utterly fatuous!  (BTW, Bietak's archaeology at<br>			Tell ed-Daba shows that the Hyksos were northern Syrians, not<br>			Indo-aryans).  Burstein concluded with two important remarks.  He<br>			stated that while Bernal contends that the cultural relationship of<br>			Greece to Egypt was analogous to that of Vietnam and Korea to China,<br>			the notion of Egyptian-Greek cultural diffusion must also take into<br>			account the pre- existing value systems of the Greeks in accepting<br>			these influences and improving on them.  Also, any exercise in<br>			identifying Egyptian elements in early Greek civilization still, when<br>			all is said and done, does not say much about the origins of Greek<br>			civilization.<br>			<br>			Eric Cline's paper, &quot;Bernal, Egyptians, and the Late Bronze Age<br>			Aegean,&quot; was a recapitulation of the cultural and economic contacts<br>			among Aegeans, Cretans, and Egyptians in the second millennium from a<br>			purely archaeological perspective.  He concluded that these indicated<br>			a commercial/trading relationship, not one of politico-military<br>			hegemony.  Among other things, he reiterated his argument that the<br>			Aegean name-list of Amenhotep III (from the latter's mortuary temple)<br>			suggests a formal Egyptian embassy sent by AIII to treat with a<br>			succession of Aegean states for commercial and political relations,<br>			not military conquest, which is Bernal's interpretation.  He faulted<br>			Bernal for using the term &quot;hegemony&quot; in defining Egypt's relationship<br>			with the Aegean in the second millennium, instead of understanding<br>			this as a period marked by extensive trade and the exchange of ideas.<br>			<br>			Pamela Gordon's paper, &quot;An Ancient Model of Autochthonous Origin,&quot;<br>			argued for what she termed an &quot;Alternate Ancient Model.&quot;  Her paper<br>			tried to show that Bernal's Ancient Model was not as absolute among<br>			the Greeks as he contends.  She described the process of how Greek<br>			notions of their own origins fluctuated from an early belief that they<br>			originated in Egypt and the Levant to a later more ethnocentric<br>			tradition of autochthony, i.e., the notion that the Greek-speaking<br>			people actually grew out of the native soil of Greece, which gave them<br>			a cultural identity separate from and superior to the East.  She<br>			traced this change, as many hellenists do, to the Persian Wars when<br>			the Greek states were endangered by the very cultures they esteemed as<br>			their wise progenitors.<br>			<br>			She described the myth of Checrops, the first king of Athens, who was<br>			born from a snake slithering under the earth, and who emerged from the<br>			ground after his birth.  She noted that the early kings and deities in<br>			Greece were often physically assimilated to snakes in art and<br>			literature, a notion deriving from the autochthonous tradition.<br>			However, what Dr. Gordon did not say, and indeed what she may not<br>			know, is that the notion of the birth of the king or deity from the<br>			body of a snake under ground actually has well documented antecedents<br>			in Egyptian religious beliefs (q.v. P. Piccione, JARCE 27 [1990]:<br>			43-52.).  This theme occurs in the Book of Amduat and the Book of<br>			Gates, where the gods Horus, Sokar, Khepri, and Atum are born from the<br>			back of a serpent; Ra travels through a serpent's body and exits via<br>			the mouth as Khepri.  Likewise, earlier in the Pyramid Texts, the<br>			deceased king is reborn into the afterlife after passing through a<br>			giant serpent's body and coming forth from its mouth.  However, at<br>			this time, I am not asserting that the Athenians actually derived the<br>			method of their autochthonic generation from the Egyptians.  That<br>			would require studying and comparing this theme in both cultures, as<br>			well as throughout the Near East.  However, if they were influenced by<br>			Egyptian cosmology in their notion of self-generation, well that would<br>			be another example of borrowing from the Egyptians.  END OF PART I<br>			<br>			<br>			<br>			I.  BERNAL'S COMMENTS.  Bernal's own commentary on the panel dealt<br>			with the main points of each of the preceding papers, which I<br>			described in Part I.  He reiterated his notion that in the second<br>			millennium B.C. all of the cultural influences in Greece were flowing<br>			from Egypt.  He barely acknowledged Walter Burkert's work by noting<br>			merely that Burkert had indicated that some influences were also<br>			coming from western Asia.  This was the one and only time, I recall,<br>			that THE ORIENTALIZING REVOLUTION was mentioned--even indirectly--at<br>			the session!  Bernal conceded that he had, indeed, neglected to<br>			consider nineteenth century American anthropologists who argued for<br>			the &quot;whiteness&quot; of the Egyptians.  He stated very strongly that he<br>			&quot;stands by his notion that the Egyptians were seen as 'white'&quot; (in the<br>			nineteenth century and later).  His argumentation here was a bit murky<br>			to me, but he excoriated those who argue the Egyptians were not black,<br>			claiming that modern blacks are enraged at the fact that while some<br>			anthropologists would apply the traditional criterion for<br>			miscegenation among African- Americans (i.e., one drop of negroid<br>			blood makes a person black), these same would also argue that the<br>			ancient Egyptians still were not black.  This appeal to racism<br>			produced a very visceral reaction among certain of the audience.<br>			However, for me, Bernal's argument appeared to be a smoke- screen,<br>			since such nineteenth century racist notions actually have no<br>			relevance for the findings of modern biological anthropology,<br>			something Bernal did not deal with, despite that Carol Thomas referred<br>			to the important study on this issue by C. Brace, et al. (YEARBOOK OF<br>			PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 36 (1993): 1-31).  He did, however, make a<br>			specious comment to the effect that certainly, &quot;the ancient Egyptians<br>			were much darker than modern Egyptians&quot; (which is, of course,<br>			insupportable).<br>			<br>			Bernal contended that Burstein and Cline were incorrect in asserting<br>			that he relied upon the Aegean name-list of Amenhotep III to prove<br>			Egyptian hegemony over the Greek and Aegean world.  Rather, he looked<br>			to Egyptian tomb reliefs depicting Mycenaeans and Cretans bearing<br>			tribute to the Egyptian king, in return for which they receive the<br>			&quot;breath of life.&quot;  This theme, he said, then meant that they were<br>			actually the subjects or under the suzerainty of the Egyptian king.<br>			(Did I groan when I heard that one!).  He certainly stuck to his guns<br>			on this issue and refused to give up his notions about &quot;hegemony,&quot;<br>			despite Burstein's and Cline's strong arguments to the contrary.  He<br>			reiterated his notion that in her origins, Greece's cultural<br>			relationship with Egypt is analogous to Japan's relationship with<br>			China.<br>			<br>			Interestingly, though, Martin Bernal is now ameliorating some of his<br>			earlier positions and is actually moving toward the middle ground.  He<br>			admitted this point himself, and said it is reflected in the recently<br>			revised edition of BLACK ATHENA, vol. 2.  E.g., he would now assert<br>			that the Aryan Model could be divided into three concurrent versions,<br>			each marked by varying degrees of contact and influence from Egypt:<br>			BROAD, which recognizes that the Greeks &quot;broadly&quot; knew the Egyptians;<br>			MEDIUM, which recognizes that the Greeks knew the Egyptians to an<br>			extent that was only &quot;so-so;&quot; EXTRA, which asserts that the Greeks did<br>			not know the Egyptians and, hence, were not influenced by them in any<br>			way (which is closest to his traditional Aryan Model).  The<br>			nomenclature is Bernal's.<br>			<br>			Bernal noted that BLACK ATHENA, vol. 3, will be published shortly, in<br>			which he demonstrates the Egyptian etymology of many Greek words.  He<br>			believes that these words entered Greek vocabulary via the alleged<br>			Egyptian colonization of Greece in the second millennium B.C.  This<br>			lexical borrowing would then account for the many Greek words denoted<br>			as &quot;origin uncertain&quot; in today's Greek dictionaries.  He then<br>			intimated that Egyptologists had no problems with his linguistic<br>			analyses, citing John Ray's review-article (JMA 3/1 (1990): 77-81).<br>			The audience nodded its head in naive agreement (as I groaned to<br>			myself again).<br>			<br>			II. MY REACTIONS.  In the discussion following the presentations, the<br>			comments were generally supportive and appreciative of Bernal's work<br>			and the notion of Egyptian influences in the development of Greek<br>			civilization.  Thus, my comments-- directed to the chair--came as a<br>			surprise to most.  I noted that I had problems with the organization<br>			of the panel, since while they were all discussing the transmission of<br>			Egyptian &quot;influences&quot; in the second millennium, there was no one on<br>			the panel who could deal with these and understand them from the<br>			Egyptian perspective.  I strongly faulted the session for not having a<br>			bona fide, mainstream Egyptologist on the panel who knew how to treat<br>			and interpret the Egyptological material.  As an example, I remarked<br>			to Bernal that his reliance on tomb paintings that depict the<br>			presentation of &quot;tribute&quot; is inappropriate for positing an historical<br>			ruler-subject relationship.  All first year Egyptology students, I<br>			explained, learn in their first art class that, in general, Egyptian<br>			art does NOT depict true historical reality, but is meant to convey<br>			notions about the ideal order of the universe and Egypt's central<br>			position there.  Similarly, Egyptian battle reliefs--by<br>			themselves--would never be conclusive proof that a particular pharaoh<br>			fought and defeated the enemy depicted.  Therefore, these &quot;tribute&quot;<br>			scenes, when coupled with notions regarding _inw_ (&quot;produce,<br>			tribute&quot;--which is the word used to define the goods being offered),<br>			actually depict products of trade and commerce--consistent with Eric<br>			Cline's arguments for such in this time period.  So, I reasoned, the<br>			panel would have benefitted by including an Egyptologist who was<br>			familiar with the subtleties of the Egyptian evidence.  The chairman<br>			of the session replied that in organizing the panel, they did not know<br>			any Egyptologists to contact!<br>			<br>			Bernal replied to my remarks about Egyptian art by stating that he was<br>			well aware of the issues I raised, and if I had read his book, I'd<br>			have known that; he didn't want to deal with such details in this<br>			forum (I've actually read his book several times).  Clearly, Bernal<br>			wants his cake and eat it, too.  He wants to spread his<br>			interpretations through such fora that are composed of generalists and<br>			non-academics, yet where the organization of such does not permit the<br>			attacking and correction of his multitudinous Egyptological details.<br>			 Surely, he did mention the forum held on this subject previously by<br>			the ARCE, where Egyptologists were able to present their views.<br>			Still, I feel my objection remained valid; there were no Egyptologists<br>			at this session, where this particular audience of generalists was<br>			being informed.  Later, one of the ancient historians on the panel<br>			expressed to me very little sympathy for my objection, noting that<br>			&quot;everyone wants their discipline to be at the center,&quot; and that<br>			Egyptologists had their chance to respond to Bernal at the ARCE<br>			meeting!!  Clearly, certain classicists and classical historians feel<br>			that this is an issue between them and Bernal only, and Near Eastern<br>			historians have only little to say or contribute.<br>			<br>			I think some attendees at the session interpreted my comments as an<br>			attack on Bernal's position, which they weren't.  As an Egyptologist<br>			and Near Eastern historian, I am quite sympathetic to arguments<br>			asserting that the Greek cities did not exist in a cultural vacuum,<br>			and that in their development they were influenced, to some extent, by<br>			Near Eastern notions and ideas (didn't James H.  Breasted espouse this<br>			thesis as early as 1916 in ANCIENT TIMES, and thereafter in 1933 in<br>			THE DAWN OF CONSCIENCE?); however, I am persuaded by Burkert that the<br>			brunt of this influence comes from western Asia, and less so from<br>			Egypt.<br>			<br>			Still, it is true that Egyptologists and Near Eastern historians have<br>			been knocking their heads against the wall for the last 78 years<br>			trying to get classical historians and academe, in general, to<br>			recognize Greece's debt to the Near East.  Martin Bernal has finally<br>			caught their attention (true, because his work fuels the narcissism of<br>			Afro-centrism with all the highly charged emotions and political<br>			correctness which that entails).  However, it's up to us, as Near<br>			Eastern specialists, to curb his excesses; to correct his overzealous<br>			interpretations, and push his work into proper perspective.  Burkert's<br>			THE ORIENTALIZING REVOLUTION is a good example of how to approach this<br>			subject.  It is ironic, though, that the original German edition of<br>			the latter (1984) predates BLACK ATHENA (1987), and as reasonable and<br>			as erudite as it is, it has not caused any of the stir of BLACK<br>			ATHENA.  Sadly, one wonders if the English translation of Burkert's<br>			study would even have been published, were it not for the stirrings of<br>			BLACK ATHENA.<br>			<br>			Peter A.
